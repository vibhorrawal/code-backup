The TCS230 is a color light-to-frequency converter on single CMOS integrated circuit.
The output is a square wave (50% duty cycle) with frequency directly proportional to light intensity (irradiance). 
The full-scale output frequency can be scaled by one of three preset values via two control input pins. 
Output enable (OE) places the output in the high-impedance state for multiple-unit sharing of a microcontroller input.


A PDF file in the library folder explains the use of sensor with the  library.


This library has a dependency on the *FreqCount* library for frequency counting (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/FreqCount). 
*Please read the setup information in the FreqCount header file or its distribution web site*,
 as the type of Arduino that you are running will determine which pin should be used for connecting to the sensor's output pin. 
_This is the most commonly asked question once the library is downloaded,
 so read the documentation and avoid frustration!_

Library example code includes:
* Simple blocking read from the sensor

* Simple RGB non-blocking read
* Example incorporating sensor calibration
* Color learning and matching
