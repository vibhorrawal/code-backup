THIS FILE WAS GENERATED ON 7 TH SEPTEMBER 2019.THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY FOE.WE DO NOT HAVE W WEEKS FOR PLANNING A STRIKE, AGAINST MOSQUITOES.ANKIT SIR TOOK CROCS TO KILL THEM. 3 D PRINTER WAS SENT FOR REPAIR. ENIGMA MACHINE WAS YYYYY.WAIT FOR NEXT CLUE TILL NEXT FORTNIGHT. CHANDRAYAN SENT THE FOLLOWING DATA.HE FIXES RADIOS BY THINKING WHEN I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN OR TWELVE I SET UP A LAB IN MY HOUSE. IT CONSISTED OF AN OLD WOODEN PACKING BOX THAT I PUT SHELVES IN. I HAD A HEATER, AND ID PUT IN FAT AND COOK FRENCHFRIED POTATOES ALL THE TIME. I ALSO HAD A STORAGE BATTERY, AND A LAMP BANK. TO BUILD THE LAMP BANK I WENT DOWN TO THE FIVEANDTEN AND GOT SOME SOCKETS YOU CAN SCREW DOWN TO A WOODEN BASE, AND CONNECTED THEM WITH PIECES OF BELL WIRE. BY MAKING DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF SWITCHESIN SERIES OR PARALLELI KNEW I COULD GET DIFFERENT VOLTAGES. BUT WHAT I HADNT REALIZED WAS THAT A BULBS RESISTANCE DEPENDS ON ITS TEMPERATURE, SO THE RESULTS OF MY CALCULATIONS WERENT THE SAME AS THE STUFF THAT CAME OUT OF THE CIRCUIT. BUT IT WAS ALL RIGHT, AND WHEN THE BULBS WERE IN SERIES, ALL HALFLIT, THEY WOULD GLOOOOOOOOOOW, VERY PRETTYIT WAS GREAT I HAD A FUSE IN THE SYSTEM SO IF I SHORTED ANYTHING, THE FUSE WOULD BLOW. NOW I HAD TO HAVE A FUSE THAT WAS WEAKER THAN THE FUSE IN THE HOUSE, SO I MADE MY OWN FUSES BY TAKING TIN FOIL AND WRAPPING IT AROUND AN OLD BURNTOUT FUSE. ACROSS MY FUSE I HAD A FIVEWATT BULB, SO WHEN MY FUSE BLEW, THE LOAD FROM THE TRICKLE CHARGER THAT WAS ALWAYS CHARGING THE STORAGE BATTERY WOULD LIGHT UP THE BULB. THE BULB WAS ON THE SWITCHBOARD BEHIND A PIECE OF BROWN CANDY PAPER IT LOOKS RED WHEN A LIGHTS BEHIND ITSO IF SOMETHING WENT OFF, ID LOOK UP TO THE SWITCHBOARD AND THERE WOULD BE A BIG RED SPOT WHERE THE FUSE WENT. IT WAS FUN I ENJOYED RADIOS. I STARTED WITH A CRYSTAL SET THAT I BOUGHT AT THE STORE, AND I USED TO LISTEN TO IT AT NIGHT IN BED WHILE I WAS GOING TO SLEEP, THROUGH A PAIR OF EARPHONES. WHEN MY MOTHER AND FATHER WENT OUT UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT, THEY WOULD COME INTO MY ROOM AND TAKE THE EARPHONES OFFAND WORRY ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING INTO MY HEAD WHILE I WAS ASLEEP. ABOUT THAT TIME I INVENTED A BURGLAR ALARM, WHICH WAS A VERY SIMPLEMINDED THING IT WAS JUST A BIG BATTERY AND A BELL CONNECTED WITH SOME WIRE. WHEN THE DOOR TO MY ROOM OPENED, IT PUSHED THE WIRE AGAINST THE BATTERY AND CLOSED THE CIRCUIT, AND THE BELL WOULD GO OFF. ONE NIGHT MY MOTHER AND FATHER CAME HOME FROM A NIGHT OUT AND VERY, VERY QUIETLY, SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE CHILD, OPENED THE DOOR TO COME INTO MY ROOM TO TAKE MY EARPHONES OFF. ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS TREMENDOUS BELL WENT OFF WITH A HELLUVA RACKETBONG BONG BONG BONG BONG I JUMPED OUT OF BED YELLING, IT WORKED IT WORKED I HAD A FORD COILA SPARK COIL FROM AN AUTOMOBILEAND I HAD THE SPARK TERMINALS AT THE TOP OF MY SWITCHBOARD. I WOULD PUT A RAYTHEON RH TUBE, WHICH HAD ARGON GAS IN IT, ACROSS THE TERMINALS, AND THE SPARK WOULD MAKE A PURPLE GLOW INSIDE THE VACUUMIT WAS JUST GREAT ONE DAY I WAS PLAYING WITH THE FORD COIL, PUNCHING HOLES IN PAPER WITH THE SPARKS, AND THE PAPER CAUGHT ON FIRE. SOON I COULDNT HOLD IT ANY MORE BECAUSE IT WAS BURNING NEAR MY FINGERS, SO I DROPPED IT IN A METAL WASTEBASKET WHICH HAD A LOT OF NEWSPAPERS IN IT. NEWSPAPERS BURN FAST, YOU KNOW, AND THE FLAME LOOKED PRETTY BIG INSIDE THE ROOM. I SHUT THE DOOR SO MY MOTHERWHO WAS PLAYING BRIDGE WITH SOME FRIENDS IN THE LIVING ROOMWOULDNT FIND OUT THERE WAS A FIRE IN MY ROOM, TOOK A MAGAZINE THAT WAS LYING NEARBY, AND PUT IT OVER THE WASTEBASKET TO SMOTHER THE FIRE. AFTER THE FIRE WAS OUT I TOOK THE MAGAZINE OFF, BUT NOW THE ROOM BEGAN TO FILL UP WITH SMOKE. THE WASTEBASKET WAS STILL TOO HOT TO HANDLE, SO I GOT A PAIR OF PLIERS, CARRIED IT ACROSS THE ROOM, AND HELD IT OUT THE WINDOW FOR THE SMOKE TO BLOW OUT.BUT BECAUSE IT WAS BREEZY OUTSIDE, THE WIND LIT THE FIRE AGAIN, AND NOW THE MAGAZINE WAS OUT OF REACH. SO I PULLED THE FLAMING WASTEBASKET BACK IN THROUGH THE WINDOW TO GET THE MAGAZINE, AND I NOTICED THERE WERE CURTAINS IN THE WINDOWIT WAS VERY DANGEROUS WELL, I GOT THE MAGAZINE, PUT THE FIRE OUT AGAIN, AND THIS TIME KEPT THE MAGAZINE WITH ME WHILE I SHOOK THE GLOWING COALS OUT OF THE WASTEPAPER BASKET ONTO THE STREET, TWO OR THREE FLOORS BELOW. THEN I WENT OUT OF MY ROOM, CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME, AND SAID TO MY MOTHER, IM GOING OUT TO PLAY, AND THE SMOKE WENT OUT SLOWLY THROUGH THE WINDOWS. I ALSO DID SOME THINGS WITH ELECTRIC MOTORS AND BUILT AN AMPLIFIER FOR A PHOTO CELL THAT I BOUGHT THAT COULD MAKE A BELL RING WHEN I PUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF THE CELL. I DIDNT GET TO DO AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO, BECAUSE MY MOTHER KEPT PUTTING ME OUT ALL THE TIME, TO PLAY. BUT I WAS OFTEN IN THE HOUSE, FIDDLING WITH MY LAB. I BOUGHT RADIOS AT RUMMAGE SALES. I DIDNT HAVE ANY MONEY, BUT IT WASNT VERY EXPENSIVETHEY WERE OLD, BROKEN RADIOS, AND ID BUY THEM AND TRY TO FIX THEM. USUALLY THEY WERE BROKEN IN SOME SIMPLEMINDED WAYSOME OBVIOUS WIRE WAS HANGING LOOSE, OR A COIL WAS BROKEN OR PARTLY UNWOUNDSO I COULD GET SOME OF THEM GOING. ON ONE OF THESE RADIOS ONE NIGHT I GOT WACO IN WACO, TEXASIT WAS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING ON THIS SAME TUBE RADIO UP IN MY LAB I WAS ABLE TO HEAR A STATION UP IN SCHENECTADY CALLED WGN. NOW, ALL OF US KIDS MY TWO COUSINS, MY SISTER, AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDSLISTENED ON THE RADIO DOWNSTAIRS TO A PROGRAM CALLED THE ENO CRIME CLUBENO EFFERVESCENT SALTSIT WAS THE THING WELL, I DISCOVERED THAT I COULD HEAR THIS PROGRAM UP IN MY LAB ON WGN ONE HOUR BEFORE IT WAS BROADCAST IN NEW YORK SO ID DISCOVER WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND THEN, WHEN WE WERE ALL SITTING AROUND THE RADIO DOWNSTAIRS LISTENING TO THE ENO CRIME CLUB, ID SAY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVENT HEARD FROM SOANDSO IN A LONG TIME. I BETCHA HE COMES AND SAVES THE SITUATION. TWO SECONDS LATER, BUPBUP, HE COMES SO THEY ALL GOT EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I PREDICTED A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS. THEN THEY REALIZED THAT THERE MUST BE SOME TRICK TO ITTHAT I MUST KNOW, SOMEHOW. SO I OWNED UP TO WHAT IT WAS, THAT I COULD HEAR IT UPSTAIRS THE HOUR BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESULT WAS, NATURALLY. NOW THEY COULDNT WAIT FOR THE REGULAR HOUR, THEY ALL HAD TO SIT UPSTAIRS IN MY LAB WITH THIS LITTLE CREAKY RADIO FOR HALF AN HOUR, LISTENING TO THE ENO CRIME CLUB FROM SCHENECTADY. WE LIVED AT THAT TIME IN A BIG HOUSE IT WAS LEFT BY MY GRANDFATHER TO HIS CHILDREN, AND THEY DIDNT HAVE MUCH MONEY ASIDE FROM THE HOUSE. IT WAS A VERY LARGE, WOODEN HOUSE, AND I WOULD RUN WIRES ALL AROUND THE OUTSIDE, AND HAD PLUGS IN ALL THE ROOMS, SO I COULD ALWAYS LISTEN TO MY RADIOS, WHICH WERE UPSTAIRS IN MY LAB. I ALSO HAD A LOUDSPEAKERNOT THE WHOLE SPEAKER, BUT THE PART WITHOUT THE BIG HORN ON IT. ONE DAY, WHEN I HAD MY EARPHONES ON, I CONNECTED THEM TO THE LOUDSPEAKER, AND I DISCOVERED SOMETHING I PUT MY FINGER IN THE SPEAKER AND I COULD HEAR IT IN THE EARPHONES I SCRATCHED THE SPEAKER AND ID HEAR IT IN THE EARPHONES. SO I DISCOVERED THAT THE SPEAKER COULD ACT LIKE A MICROPHONE, AND YOU DIDNT EVEN NEED ANY BATTERIES. AT SCHOOL WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL, SO I GAVE A DEMONSTRATION OF THE SPEAKER AND THE EARPHONES. I DIDNT KNOW IT AT THE TIME, BUT I THINK IT WAS THE TYPE OF TELEPHONE HE ORIGINALLY USED. SO NOW I HAD A MICROPHONE, AND I COULD BROADCAST FROM UPSTAIRS TO DOWNSTAIRS, AND FROM DOWNSTAIRS TO UPSTAIRS, USING THE AMPLIFIERS OF MY RUMMAGESALE RADIOS. AT THAT TIME MY SISTER JOAN, WHO WAS NINE YEARS YOUNGER THAN I WAS, MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWO OR THREE, AND THERE WAS A GUY ONTHE RADIO CALLED UNCLE DON THAT SHE LIKED TO LISTEN TO. HED SING LITTLE SONGS ABOUT GOOD CHILDREN, AND SO ON, AND HED READ CARDS SENT IN BY PARENTS TELLING THAT MARY SOANDSO IS HAVING A BIRTHDAY THIS SATURDAY AT  FLATBUSH AVENUE. ONE DAY MY COUSIN FRANCIS AND I SAT JOAN DOWN AND SAID THAT THERE WAS A SPECIAL PROGRAM SHE SHOULD LISTEN TO. THEN WE RAN UPSTAIRS AND WE STARTED TO BROADCAST THIS IS UNCLE DON. WE KNOW A VERY NICE LITTLE GIRL NAMED JOAN WHO LIVES ON NEW BROADWAY SHES GOT A BIRTHDAY COMINGNOT TODAY, BUT SUCHANDSUCH. SHES A CUTE GIRL. WE SANG A LITTLE SONG, AND THEN WE MADE MUSIC DEEDLE LEET DEET, DOODLE DOODLE LOOT DOOT DEEDLE DEEDLE LEET, DOODLE LOOT DOOT DOO WE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE DEAL, AND THEN WE CAME DOWNSTAIRS HOW WAS IT DID YOU LIKE THE PROGRAM IT WAS GOOD, SHE SAID, BUT WHY DID YOU MAKE THE MUSIC WITH YOUR MOUTH ONE DAY I GOT A TELEPHONE CALL MISTER, ARE YOU RICHARD FEYNMAN  YES. THIS IS A HOTEL. WE HAVE A RADIO THAT DOESNT WORK, AND WOULD LIKE IT REPAIRED. WE UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BUT IM ONLY A LITTLE BOY, I SAID. I DONT KNOW HOW YES, WE KNOW THAT, BUT WED LIKE YOU TO COME OVER ANYWAY. IT WAS A HOTEL THAT MY AUNT WAS RUNNING, BUT I DIDNT KNOW THAT. I WENT OVER THERE WITHTHEY STILL TELL THE STORYA BIG SCREWDRIVER IN MY BACK POCKET. WELL, I WAS SMALL, SO ANY SCREWDRIVER LOOKED BIG IN MY BACK POCKET. I WENT UP TO THE RADIO AND TRIED TO FIX IT. I DIDNT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT THERE WAS ALSO A HANDYMAN AT THE HOTEL, AND EITHER HE NOTICED, OR I NOTICED, A LOOSE KNOB ON THE RHEOSTATTO TURN UP THE VOLUMESO THAT IT WASNT TURNING THE SHAFT. HE WENT OFF AND FILED SOMETHING, AND FIXED IT UP SO IT WORKED. THE NEXT RADIO I TRIED TO FIX DIDNT WORK AT ALL. THAT WAS EASY IT WASNT PLUGGED IN RIGHT. AS THE REPAIR JOBS GOT MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED, I GOT BETTER AND BETTER, AND MORE ELABORATE. I BOUGHT MYSELF A MILLIAMMETER IN NEW YORK AND CONVERTED IT INTO A VOLTMETER THAT HAD DIFFERENT SCALES ON IT BY USING THE RIGHT LENGTHS WHICH I CALCULATED OF VERY FINE COPPER WIRE. IT WASNT VERY ACCURATE, HUT IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO TELL WHETHER THINGS WERE IN THE RIGHT BALLPARK AT DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS IN THOSE RADIO SETS. THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE HIRED ME WAS THE DEPRESSION. THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY MONEY TO FIX THEIR RADIOS, AND THEYD HEAR ABOUT THIS KID WHO WOULD DO IT FOR LESS. SO ID CLIMB ON ROOFS TO FIX ANTENNAS, AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF. I GOT A SERIES OF LESSONS OF EVERINCREASING DIFFICULTY. ULTIMATELY I GOT SOME JOB LIKE CONVERTING A DC SET INTO AN AC SET, AND IT WAS VERY HARD TO KEEP THE HUM FROM GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM, AND I DIDNT BUILD IT QUITE RIGHT. I SHOULDNT HAVE BITTEN THAT ONE OFF, BUT I DIDNT KNOW. ONE JOB WAS REALLY SENSATIONAL. I WAS WORKING AT THE TIME FOR A PRINTER, AND A MAN WHO KNEW THAT PRINTER KNEW I WAS TRYING TO GET JOBS FIXING RADIOS, SO HE SENT A FELLOW AROUND TO THE PRINT SHOP TO PICK ME UP. THE GUY IS OBVIOUSLY POORHIS CAR IS A COMPLETE WRECKAND WE GO TO HIS HOUSE WHICH IS IN A CHEAP PART OF TOWN. ON THE WAY, I SAY, WHATS THE TROUBLE WITH THE RADIO HE SAYS, WHEN I TURN IT ON IT MAKES A NOISE, AND AFTER A WHILE THE NOISE STOPS AND EVERYTHINGS ALL RIGHT, BUT I DONT LIKE THE NOISE AT THE BEGINNING.I THINK TO MYSELF WHAT THE HELL IF HE HASNT GOT ANY MONEY, YOUD THINK HE COULD STAND A LITTLE NOISE FOR A WHILE. AND ALL THE TIME, ON THE WAY TO HIS HOUSE, HES SAYING THINGS LIKE, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RADIOS HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RADIOSYOURE JUST A LITTLE BOY HES PUTTING ME DOWN THE WHOLE WAY, AND IM THINKING, SO WHATS THE MATTER WITH HIM SO IT MAKES A LITTLE NOISE. BUT WHEN WE GOT THERE I WENT OVER TO THE RADIO AND TURNED IT ON. LITTLE NOISE MY GOD NO WONDER THE POOR GUY COULDNT STAND IT. THE THING BEGAN TO ROAR AND WOBBLEWUH BUH BUH BUH BUHA TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NOISE. THEN IT QUIETED DOWN AND PLAYED CORRECTLY. SO I STARTED TO THINK HOW CAN THAT HAPPEN I START WALKING BACK AND FORTH, THINKING, AND I REALIZE THAT ONE WAY IT CAN HAPPEN IS THAT THE TUBES ARE HEATING UP IN THE WRONG ORDERTHAT IS, THE AMPLIFIERS ALL HOT, THE TUBES ARE READY TO GO, AND THERES NOTHING FEEDING IN, OR THERES SOME BACK CIRCUIT FEEDING IN, OR SOMETHING WRONG IN THE BEGINNING PARTTHE HF PARTAND THEREFORE ITS MAKING A LOT OF NOISE, PICKING UP SOMETHING. AND WHEN THE RF CIRCUITS FINALLY GOING, AND THE GRID VOLTAGES ARE ADJUSTED, EVERYTHINGS ALL RIGHT. SO THE GUY SAYS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU COME TO FIX THE RADIO, BUT YOURE ONLY WALKING BACK AND FORTH I SAY, IM THINKING THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, ALL RIGHT, TAKE THE TUBES OUT, AND REVERSE THE ORDER COMPLETELY IN THE SET. MANY RADIO SETS IN THOSE DAYS USED THE SAME TUBES IN DIFFERENT PLACESS, I THINK THEY WERE, OR AS. SO I CHANGED THE TUBES AROUND, STEPPED TO THE FRONT OF THE RADIO, TURNED THE THING ON, AND ITS AS QUIET AS A LAMB IT WAITS UNTIL IT HEATS UP, AND THEN PLAYS PERFECTLYNO NOISE. WHEN A PERSON HAS BEEN NEGATIVE TO YOU, AND THEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THEYRE USUALLY A HUNDRED PERCENT THE OTHER WAY, KIND OF TO COMPENSATE. HE GOT ME OTHER JOBS, AND KEPT TELLING EVERYBODY WHAT A TREMENDOUS GENIUS I WAS, SAYING, HE FIXES RADIOS BY THINKING THE WHOLE IDEA OF THINKING, TO FIX A RADIOA LITTLE BOY STOPS AND THINKS, AND FIGURES OUT HOW TO DO ITHE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAS POSSIBLE. RADIO CIRCUITS WERE MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IN THOSE DAYS BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS OUT IN THE OPEN. AFTER YOU TOOK THE SET APART IT WAS A BIG PROBLEM TO FIND THE RIGHT SCREWS, YOU COULD SEE THIS WAS A RESISTOR, THATS A CONDENSER, HERES A THIS, THERES A THAT THEY WERE ALL LABELED. AND IF WAX HAD BEEN DRIPPING FROM THE CONDENSER, IT WAS TOO HOT AND YOU COULD TELL THAT THE CONDENSER WAS BURNED OUT. IF THERE WAS CHARCOAL ON ONE OF THE RESISTORS YOU KNEW WHERE THE TROUBLE WAS. OR, IF YOU COULDNT TELL WHAT WAS THE MATTER BY LOOKING AT IT, YOUD TEST IT WITH YOUR VOLTMETER AND SEE WHETHER VOLTAGE WAS COMING THROUGH. THE SETS WERE SIMPLE, THE CIRCUITS WERE NOT COMPLICATED. THE VOLTAGE ON THE GRIDS WAS ALWAYS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF OR TWO VOLTS AND THE VOLTAGES ON THE PLATES WERE ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED, DC. SO IT WASNT HARD FOR ME TO FIX A RADIO BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE, NOTICING THAT SOMETHING WASNT WORKING RIGHT, AND FIXING IT. SOMETIMES IT TOOK QUITE A WHILE. I REMEMBER ONE PARTICULAR TIME WHEN IT TOOK THE WHOLE AFTERNOON TO FIND A BURNEDOUT RESISTOR THAT WAS NOT APPARENT. THAT PARTICULAR TIME IT HAPPENED TO BE A FRIEND OF MY MOTHER, SO I HAD TIMETHERE WAS NOBODY ON MY BACK SAYING, WHAT ARE YOU DOING INSTEAD, THEY WERE SAYING, WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE MILK, OR SOME CAKE I FINALLY FIXED IT BECAUSE I HAD, AND STILL HAVE, PERSISTENCE. ONCE I GET ON A PUZZLE, I CANT GET OFF. IF MY MOTHERS FRIEND HAD SAID, NEVER MIND, ITS TOO MUCH WORK, ID HAVE BLOWN MY TOP, BECAUSE I WANT TO BEAT THIS DAMNTHING, AS LONG AS IVE GONE THIS FAR. I CANT JUST LEAVE IT AFTER IVE FOUND OUT SO MUCH ABOUT IT. I HAVE TO KEEP GOING TO FIND OUT ULTIMATELY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH IT IN THE END. THATS A PUZZLE DRIVE. ITS WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR MY WANTING TO DECIPHER MAYAN HIEROGLYPHICS, FOR TRYING TO OPEN SAFES. I REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL, DURING FIRST PERIOD A GUY WOULD COME TO ME WITH A PUZZLE IN GEOMETRY, OR SOMETHING WHICH HAD BEEN ASSIGNED IN HIS ADVANCED MATH CLASS. I WOULDNT STOP UNTIL I FIGURED THE DAMN THING OUTIT WOULD TAKE ME FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES. BUT DURING THE DAY, OTHER GUYS WOULD COME TO ME WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, AND ID DO IT FOR THEM IN A FLASH. SO FOR ONE GUY, TO DO IT TOOK ME TWENTY MINUTES, WHILE THERE WERE FIVE GUYS WHO THOUGHT I WAS A SUPERGENIUS. SO I GOT A FANCY REPUTATION. DURING HIGH SCHOOL EVERY PUZZLE THAT WAS KNOWN TO MAN MUST HAVE COME TO ME. EVERY DAMN, CRAZY CONUNDRUM THAT PEOPLE HAD INVENTED, I KNEW. SO WHEN I GOT TO MIT THERE WAS A DANCE, AND ONE OF THE SENIORS HAD HIS GIRLFRIEND THERE, AND SHE KNEW A LOT OF PUZZLES, AND HE WAS TELLING HER THAT I WAS PRETTY GOOD AT THEM. SO DURING THE DANCE SHE CAME OVER TO ME AND SAID, THEY SAY YOURE A SMART GUY, SO HERES ONE FOR YOU A MAN HAS EIGHT CORDS OF WOOD TO CHOP . . . AND I SAID, HE STARTS BY CHOPPING EVERY OTHER ONE IN THREE PARTS, BECAUSE I HAD HEARD THAT ONE. THEN SHED GO AWAY AND COME BACK WITH ANOTHER ONE, AND ID ALWAYS KNOW IT. THIS WENT ON FOR QUITE A WHILE, AND FINALLY, NEAR THE END OF THE DANCE, SHE CAME OVER, LOOKING AS IF SHE WAS GOING TO GET ME FOR SURE THIS TIME, AND SHE SAID, A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ARE TRAVELING TO EUROPE . . . THE DAUGHTER GOT THE BUBONIC PLAGUE. SHE COLLAPSED THAT WAS HARDLY ENOUGH CLUES TO GET THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE IT WAS THE LONG STORY ABOUT HOW A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER STOP AT A HOTEL AND STAY IN SEPARATE ROOMS, AND THE NEXT DAY THE MOTHER GOES TO THE DAUGHTERS ROOM AND THERES NOBODY THERE, OR SOMEBODY ELSE IS THERE, AND SHE SAYS, WHERES MY DAUGHTER AND THE HOTEL KEEPER SAYS, WHAT DAUGHTER AND THE REGISTERS GOT ONLY THE MOTHERS NAME, AND SO ON, AND SO ON, AND THERES A BIG MYSTERY AS TO WHAT HAPPENED. THE ANSWER IS, THE DAUGHTER GOT BUBONIC PLAGUE, AND THE HOTEL, NOT WANTING TO HAVE TO CLOSE UP, SPIRITS THE DAUGHTER AWAY, CLEANS UP THE ROOM, AND ERASES ALL EVIDENCE OF HER HAVING BEEN THERE. IT WAS A LONG TALE, BUT I HAD HEARD IT, SO WHEN THE GIRL STARTED OUT WITH, A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ARE TRAVELING TO EUROPE, I KNEW ONE THING THAT STARTED THAT WAY, SO I TOOK A FLYING GUESS, AND GOT IT. WE HAD A THING AT HIGH SCHOOL CALLED THE ALGEBRA TEAM, WHICH CONSISTED OF FIVE KIDS, AND WE WOULD TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AS A TEAM AND HAVE COMPETITIONS. WE WOULD SIT IN ONE ROW OF SEATS AND THE OTHER TEAM WOULD SIT IN ANOTHER ROW. A TEACHER, WHO WAS RUNNING THE CONTEST, WOULD TAKE OUT AN ENVELOPE, AND ON THE ENVELOPE IT SAYS FORTYFIVE SECONDS. SHE OPENS IT UP, WRITES THE PROBLEM ON THE BLACKBOARD, AND SAYS, GOSO YOU REALLY HAVE MORE THAN FORTYFIVE SECONDS BECAUSE WHILE SHES WRITING YOU CAN THINK. NOW THE GAME WAS THIS YOU HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER, AND ON IT YOU CAN WRITE ANYTHING, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTED WAS THE ANSWER. IF THE ANSWER WAS SIX BOOKS, YOUD HAVE TO WRITE , AND PUT A BIG CIRCLE AROUND IT. IF WHAT WAS IN THE CIRCLE WAS RIGHT, YOU WON IF IT WASNT, YOU LOST. ONE THING WAS FOR SURE IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THE PROBLEM IN ANY CONVENTIONAL, STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY, LIKE PUTTING A IS THE NUMBER OF RED BOOKS, B IS THE NUMBER OF BLUE BOOKS, GRIND, GRIND, GRIND, UNTIL YOU GET SIX BOOKS. THAT WOULD TAKE YOU FIFTY SECONDS, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO SET UP THE TIMINGS ON THESE PROBLEMS HAD MADE THEM ALL A TRIFLE SHORT. SO YOU HAD TO THINK, IS THERE A WAY TO SEE IT SOMETIMES YOU COULD SEE IT IN A FLASH, AND SOMETIMES YOUD HAVE TO INVENTANOTHER WAY TO DO IT AND THEN DO THE ALGEBRA AS FAST AS YOU COULD. IT WAS WONDERFUL PRACTICE, AND I GOT BETTER AND BETTER, AND I EVENTUALLY GOT TO BE THE HEAD OF THE TEAM. SO I LEARNED TO DO ALGEBRA VERY QUICKLY, AND IT CAME IN HANDY IN COLLEGE. WHEN WE HAD A PROBLEM IN CALCULUS, I WAS VERY QUICK TO SEE WHERE IT WAS GOING AND TO DO THE ALGEBRAFAST. ANOTHER THING I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS TO INVENT PROBLEMS AND THEOREMS. I MEAN, IF I WERE DOING ANY MATHEMATICAL THING AT ALL, I WOULD FIND SOME PRACTICAL EXAMPLE FOR WHICH IT WOULD BE USEFUL. I INVENTED A SET OF RIGHTTRIANGLE PROBLEMS. BUT INSTEAD OF GIVING THE LENGTHS OF TWO OF THE SIDES TO FIND THE THIRD, I GAVE THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TWO SIDES. A TYPICAL EXAMPLE WAS THERES A FLAGPOLE, AND THERES A ROPE THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE TOP. WHEN YOU HOLD THE ROPE STRAIGHT DOWN, ITS THREE FEET LONGER THAN THE POLE, AND WHEN YOU PULL THE ROPE OUT TIGHT, ITS FIVE FEET FROM THE BASE OF THE POLE. HOW HIGH IS THE POLE I DEVELOPED SOME EQUATIONS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS LIKE THAT, AND AS A RESULT I NOTICED SOME CONNECTIONPERHAPS IT WAS SIN  COS  THAT REMINDED ME OF TRIGONOMETRY. NOW, A FEW YEARS EARLIER, PERHAPS WHEN I WAS ELEVEN OR TWELVE, I HAD READ A BOOK ON TRIGONOMETRY THAT I HAD CHECKED OUT FROM THE LIBRARY, BUT THE BOOK WAS BY NOW LONG GONE. I REMEMBERED ONLY THAT TRIGONOMETRY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH RELATIONS BETWEEN SINES AND COSINES. SO I BEGAN TO WORK OUT ALL THE RELATIONS BY DRAWING TRIANGLES, AND EACH ONE I PROVED BY MYSELF. I ALSO CALCULATED THE SINE, COSINE, AND TANGENT OF EVERY FIVE DEGREES, STARTING WITH THE SINE OF FIVE DEGREES AS GIVEN, BY ADDITION AND HALFANGLE FORMULAS THAT I HAD WORKED OUT. A FEW YEARS LATER, WHEN WE STUDIED TRIGONOMETRY IN SCHOOL, I STILL HAD MY NOTES AND I SAW THAT MY DEMONSTRATIONS WERE OFTEN DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE BOOK. SOMETIMES, FOR A THING WHERE I DIDNT NOTICE A SIMPLE WAY TO DO IT, I WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE TILL I GOT IT. OTHER TIMES, MY WAY WAS MOST CLEVERTHE STANDARD DEMONSTRATION IN THE BOOK WAS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED SO SOMETIMES I HAD EM HEAT, AND SOMETIMES IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND. WHILE I WAS DOING ALL THIS TRIGONOMETRY, I DIDNT LIKE THE SYMBOLS FOR SINE, COSINE, TANGENT, AND SO ON. TO ME, SIN F LOOKED LIKE S TIMES I TIMES N TIMES F SO I INVENTED ANOTHER SYMBOL, LIKE A SQUARE ROOT SIGN, THAT WAS A SIGMA WITH A LONG ARM STICKING OUT OF IT, AND I PUT THE F UNDERNEATH. FOR THE TANGENT IT WAS A TAU WITH THE TOP OF THE TAU EXTENDED, AND FOR THE COSINE I MADE A KIND OF GAMMA, BUT IT LOOKED A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE SQUARE ROOT SIGN. NOW THE INVERSE SINE WAS THE SAME SIGMA, BUT LEFTTORIGHT REFLECTED SO THAT IT STARTED WITH THE HORIZONTAL LINE WITH THE VALUE UNDERNEATH, AND THEN THE SIGMA. THAT WAS THE INVERSE SINE, NOT SINK FTHAT WAS CRAZY THEY HAD THAT IN BOOKS TO ME, SINI MEANT ISINE, THE RECIPROCAL. SO MY SYMBOLS WERE BETTER. I DIDNT LIKE FXTHAT LOOKED TO ME LIKE F TIMES X. I ALSO DIDNT LIKE DYDXYOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO CANCEL THE DSSO I MADE A DIFFERENT SIGN, SOMETHING LIKE AN  SIGN. FOR LOGARITHMS IT WAS A BIG L EXTENDED TO THE RIGHT, WITH THE THING YOU TAKE THE LOG OF INSIDE, AND SO ON. I THOUGHT MY SYMBOLS WERE JUST AS GOOD, IF NOT BETTER, THAN THE REGULAR SYMBOLSIT DOESNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT SYMBOLS YOU USEBUT I DISCOVERED LATER THAT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. ONCE WHEN I WAS EXPLAINING SOMETHING TO ANOTHER KID IN HIGH SCHOOL, WITHOUT THINKING I STARTED TO MAKE THESE SYMBOLS, AND HE SAID, WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE I REALIZED THEN THAT IF IM GOING TO TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE, ILL HAVE TO USE THE STANDARD SYMBOLS, SO I EVENTUALLY GAVE UP MY OWN SYMBOLS. I HAD ALSO INVENTED A SET OF SYMBOLS FOR THE TYPEWRITER, LIKE FORTRAN HAS TO DO, SO I COULD TYPE EQUATIONS. I ALSO FIXED TYPEWRITERS, WITH PAPER CLIPS AND RUBBER BANDS THE RUBBER BANDS DIDNT BREAKDOWN LIKE THEY DO HERE IN LOS ANGELES, HUT I WASNT A PROFESSIONAL REPAIRMAN ID JUST FIX THEM SO THEY WOULD WORK. BUT THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF DISCOVERING WHAT WAS THE MATTER, AND FIGURING OUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO FIX ITTHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME, LIKE A PUZZLE.STRING BEANS I MUST HAVE BEEN SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN WHEN I WORKED ONE SUMMER IN A HOTEL RUN BY MY AUNT. I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH I GOTTWENTYTWO DOLLARS A MONTH, I THINKAND I ALTERNATED ELEVEN HOURS ONE DAY AND THIRTEEN THE NEXT AS A DESK CLERK OR AS A BUSBOY IN THE RESTAURANT. AND DURING THE AFTERNOON, WHEN YOU WERE DESK CLERK, YOU HAD TO BRING MILK UP TO MRS. D, AN INVALID WOMAN WHO NEVER GAVE US A TIP. THATS THE WAY THE WORLD WAS YOU WORKED LONG HOURS AND GOT NOTHING FOR IT, EVERY DAY. THIS WAS A RESORT HOTEL, BY THE BEACH, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NEW YORK CITY. THE HUSBANDS WOULD GO TO WORK IN THE CITY AND LEAVE THE WIVES BEHIND TO PLAY CARDS, SO YOU WOULD ALWAYS HAVE TO GET THE BRIDGE TABLES OUT. THEN AT NIGHT THE GUYS WOULD PLAY POKER, SO YOUD GET THE TABLES READY FOR THEMCLEAN OUT THE ASHTRAYS AND SO ON. I WAS ALWAYS UP UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT, LIKE TWO OCLOCK, SO IT REALLY WAS THIRTEEN AND ELEVEN HOURS A DAY. THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS I DIDNT LIKE, SUCH AS TIPPING. I THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE PAID MORE, AND NOT HAVE TO HAVE ANY TIPS. BUT WHEN I PROPOSED THAT TO THE BOSS, I GOT NOTHING BUT LAUGHTER. SHE TOLD EVERYBODY, RICHARD DOESNT WANT HIS TIPS, HEE, HEE, HEE HE DOESNT WANT HIS TIPS, HA, HA, HA. THE WORLD IS FULL OF THIS KIND OF DUMB SMARTALEC WHO DOESNT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. ANYWAY, AT ONE STAGE THERE WAS A GROUP OF MEN WHO, WHEN THEYD COME BACK FROM WORKING IN THE CITY, WOULD RIGHT AWAY WANT ICE FOR THEIR DRINKS. NOW THE OTHER GUY WORKING WITH ME HAD REALLY BEEN A DESK CLERK. HE WAS OLDER THAN I WAS, AND A LOT MORE PROFESSIONAL. ONE TIME HE SAID TO ME, LISTEN, WERE ALWAYS BRINGING ICE UP TO THAT GUY UNGAR AND HE NEVER GIVES US A TIPNOT EVEN TEN CENTS. NEXT TIME, WHEN THEY ASK FOR ICE, JUST DONT DO A DAMN THING. THEN THEYLL CALL YOU BACK, AND WHEN THEY CALL YOU BACK, YOU SAY, OH, IM SORRY. I FORGOT. WERE ALL FORGETFUL SOMETIMES. SO I DID IT, AND UNGAR GAVE ME FIFTEEN CENTS BUT NOW, WHEN I THINK BACK ON IT, I REALIZE THAT THE OTHER DESK CLERK, THE PROFESSIONAL, HAD REALLY KNOWN WHAT TO DOTELL THE OTHER GUY TO TAKE THE RISK OF GETTING INTO TROUBLE. HE PUT ME TO THE JOB OF TRAINING THIS FELLA TO GIVE TIPS. HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING HE MADE ME DO IT I HAD TO CLEAN UP TABLES IN THE DINING ROOM AS A BUSBOY. YOU PILE ALL THIS STUFF FROM THE TABLES ON TO A TRAY AT THE SIDE, AND WHEN IT GETS HIGH ENOUGH YOU CARRY IT INTO THE KITCHEN. SO YOU GET A NEW TRAY, RIGHT YOU SHOULD DO IT IN TWO STEPSTAKE THE OLD TRAY AWAY, AND PUT IN A NEW ONEBUT I THOUGHT, IM GOING TO DO IT IN ONE STEP. SO I TRIED TO SLIDE THE NEW TRAY UNDER, AND PULL THE OLD TRAY OUT AT THE SAME TIME, AND IT SLIPPEDBANG ALL THE STUFF WENT ON THE FLOOR. AND THEN, NATURALLY, THE QUESTION WAS, WHAT WERE YOU DOING HOW DID IT FALL WELL, HOW COULD I EXPLAIN THAT I WAS TRYING TO INVENT A NEW WAY TO HANDLE TRAYS AMONG THE DESSERTS THERE WAS SOME KIND OF COFFEE CAKE THAT CAME OUT VERY PRETTY ON A DOILY, ON A LITTLE PLATE. BUT IF YOU WOULD GO IN THE BACK YOUD SEE A MAN CALLED THE PANTRY MAN. HIS PROBLEM WAS TO GET THE STUFF READY FOR DESSERTS. NOW THIS MAN MUST HAVE BEEN A MINER, OR SOMETHINGHEAVY BUILT, WITH VERY STUBBY, ROUNDED, THICK FINGERS. HED TAKE THIS STACK OF DOILIES, WHICH ARE MANUFACTURED BY SOME SORT OF STAMPING PROCESS, ALL STUCK TOGETHER, AND HED TAKE THESE STUBBY FINGERS AND TRY TO SEPARATE THE DOILIES TO PUT THEM ON THE PLATES. I ALWAYS HEARD HIM SAY, DAMN DEEZ DOILIES WHILE HE WAS DOING THIS, AND I REMEMBER THINKING, WHAT A CONTRASTTHE PERSON SITTING AT THE TABLE GETS THIS NICE CAKE ON A DOILIED PLATE, WHILE THE PANTRY MAN BACK THERE WITH THE STUBBY THUMBS IS SAYING, DAMN DEEZ DOILIES SO THAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.MY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB THE PANTRY LADY EXPLAINED THAT SHE USUALLY MADE A HAM SANDWICH, OR SOMETHING, FOR THE GUY WHO WAS ON THE LATE SHIFT. I SAID THAT I LIKED DESSERTS, SO IF THERE WAS A DESSERT LEFT OVER FROM SUPPER, ID LIKE THAT. THE NEXT NIGHT I WAS ON THE LATE SHIFT TILL  A.M. WITH THESE GUYS PLAYING POKER. I WAS SITTING AROUND WITH NOTHING TO DO, GETTING BORED, WHEN SUDDENLY I REMEMBERED THERE WAS A DESSERT TO EAT. I WENT OVER TO THE ICEBOX AND OPENED IT UP, AND THERE SHED LEFT SIX DESSERTS THERE WAS A CHOCOLATE PUDDING, A PIECE OF CAKE, SOME PEACH SLICES, SOME RICE PUDDING, SOME JELLOTHERE WAS EVERYTHING SO I SAT THERE AND ATE THE SIX DESSERTSIT WAS SENSATIONAL THE NEXT DAY SHE SAID TO ME, I LEFT A DESSERT FOR YOU. IT WAS WONDERFUL, I SAID, ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BUT I LEFT YOU SIX DESSERTS BECAUSE I DIDNT KNOW WHICH ONE YOU LIKED THE BEST. SO FROM THAT TIME ON SHE LEFT SIX DESSERTS. THEY WERENT ALWAYS DIFFERENT, BUT THERE WERE ALWAYS SIX DESSERTS. ONE TIME WHEN I WAS DESK CLERK A GIRL LEFT A BOOK BY THE TELEPHONE AT THE DESK WHILE SHE WENT TO EAT DINNER, SO I LOOKED AT. IT. IT WAS THE LIFE OF LEONARDO, AND I COULDNT RESIST THE GIRL LET ME BORROW IT AND I READ THE WHOLE THING. I SLEPT IN A LITTLE ROOM IN THE BACK OF THE HOTEL, AND THERE WAS SOME STEW ABOUT TURNING OUT THE LIGHTS WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR ROOM, WHICH I COULDNT EVER REMEMBER TO DO. INSPIRED BY THE LEONARDO BOOK, I MADE THIS GADGET WHICH CONSISTED OF A SYSTEM OF STRINGS AND WEIGHTSCOKE BOTTLES FULL OF WATER THAT WOULD OPERATE WHEN ID OPEN THE DOOR, LIGHTING THE PULLCHAIN LIGHT INSIDE. YOU OPEN THE DOOR, AND THINGS WOULD GO, AND LIGHT THE LIGHT THEN YOU CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND YOU, AND THE LIGHT WOULD GO OUT. BUT MY REAL ACCOMPLISHMENT CAME LATER. I USED TO CUT VEGETABLES IN THE KITCHEN. STRING BEANS HAD TO BE CUT INTO ONEINCH PIECES. THE WAY YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT WAS YOU HOLD TWO BEANS IN ONE HAND, THE KNIFE IN THE OTHER, AND YOU PRESS THE KNIFE AGAINST THE BEANS AND YOUR THUMB, ALMOST CUTTING YOURSELF. IT WAS A SLOW PROCESS. SO I PUT MY MIND TO IT, AND I GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. I SAT DOWN AT THE WOODEN TABLE OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, PUT A BOWL IN MY LAP, AND STUCK A VERY SHARP KNIFE INTO THE TABLE AT A FORTYFIVEDEGREE ANGLE AWAY FROM ME. THEN I PUT A PILE OF THE STRING BEANS ON EACH SIDE, AND ID PICK OUT A BEAN, ONE IN EACH HAND, AND BRING IT TOWARDS ME WITH ENOUGH SPEED THAT IT WOULD SLICE, AND THE PIECES WOULD SLIDE INTO THE BOWL THAT WAS IN MY LAP. SO IM SLICING BEANS ONE AFTER THE OTHERCHIG, CHIG, CHIG, CHIG, CHIGAND EVERYBODYS GIVING ME THE BEANS, AND IM GOING LIKE SIXTY WHEN THE BOSS COMES BY AND SAYS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING I SAY, LOOK AT THE WAY I HAVE OF CUTTING BEANSAND JUST AT THAT MOMENT I PUT A FINGER THROUGH INSTEAD OF A BEAN. BLOOD CAME OUT AND WENT ON THE BEANS, AND THERE WAS A BIG EXCITEMENT LOOK AT HOW MANY BEANS YOU SPOILED WHAT A STUPID WAY TO DO THINGS AND SO ON. SO I WAS NEVER ABLE TO MAKE ANY IMPROVEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EASYWITH A GUARD, OR SOMETHINGBUT NO, THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR IMPROVEMENT. I HAD ANOTHER INVENTION, WHICH HAD A SIMILAR DIFFICULTY. WE HAD TO SLICE POTATOES AFTER THEYD BEEN COOKED, FOR SOME KIND OF POTATO SALAD. THEY WERE STICKY AND WET, AND DIFFICULT TO HANDLE. I THOUGHT OF A WHOLE LOT OF KNIVES, PARALLEL IN A RACK, COMING DOWN AND SLICING THE WHOLE THING. I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LONG TIME, AND FINALLY I GOT THE IDEA OF WIRES IN A RACK, SO I WENT TO THE FIVEANDTEN TO BUY SOME KNIVES OR WIRES, AND SAW EXACTLY THE GADGET I WANTED IT WAS FOR SLICING EGGS. THE NEXT TIME THE POTATOES CAME OUT I GOT MY LITTLE EGGSLICER OUT AND SLICEDALL THE POTATOES IN NO TIME, AND SENT THEM BACK TO THE CHEF. THE CHEF WAS A GERMAN, A GREAT BIG GUY WHO WAS KING OF THE KITCHEN, AND HE CAME STORMING OUT, BLOOD VESSELS STICKING OUT OF HIS NECK, LIVID RED. WHATS THE MATTER WITH THE POTATOES HE SAYS. THEYRE NOT SLICED I HAD THEM SLICED, BUT THEY WERE ALL STUCK TOGETHER. HE SAYS, HOW CAN I SEPARATE THEM STICK EM IN WATER, I SUGGEST. IN WATER EAGHHHHHHHHHHH ANOTHER TIME I HAD A REALLY GOOD IDEA. WHEN I WAS DESK CLERK I HAD TO ANSWER THE TELEPHONE. WHEN A CALL CAME IN, SOMETHING BUZZED, AND A FLAP CAME DOWN ON THE SWITCHBOARD SO YOU COULD TELL WHICH LINE IT WAS. SOMETIMES, WHEN I WAS HELPING THE WOMEN WITH THE BRIDGE TABLES OR SITTING ON THE FRONT PORCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WHEN THERE WERE VERY FEW CALLS, ID BE SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SWITCHBOARD WHEN SUDDENLY IT WOULD GO. ID COME RUNNING TO CATCH IT, BUT THE WAY THE DESK WAS MADE, IN ORDER TO GET TO THE SWITCHBOARD YOU HAD TO GO QUITE A DISTANCE FURTHER DOWN, THEN AROUND, IN BEHIND, AND THEN BACK UP TO SEE WHERE THE CALL WAS COMING FROMIT TOOK EXTRA TIME. SO I GOT A GOOD IDEA. I TIED THREADS TO THE FLAPS ON THE SWITCHBOARD, AND STRUNG THEM OVER THE TOP OF THE DESK AND THEN DOWN, AND AT THE END OF EACH THREAD I TIED A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER. THEN I PUT THE TELEPHONE TALKING PIECE UP ON TOP OF THE DESK, SO I COULD REACH IT FROM THE FRONT. NOW, WHEN A CALL CAME, I COULD TELL WHICH FLAP WAS DOWN BY WHICH PIECE OF PAPER WAS UP, SO I COULD ANSWER THE PHONE APPROPRIATELY, FROM THE FRONT, TO SAVE TIME. OF COURSE I STILL HAD TO GO AROUND BACK TO SWITCH IT IN, BUT AT LEAST I WAS ANSWERING IT. ID SAY, JUST A MOMENT, AND THEN GO AROUND TO SWITCH IT IN. I THOUGHT THAT WAS PERFECT, BUT THE BOSS CAME BY ONE DAY, AND SHE WANTED TO ANSWER THE PHONE, AND SHE COULDNT FIGURE IT OUTTOO COMPLICATED. WHAT ARE ALL THESE PAPERS DOING WHY IS THE TELEPHONE ON THIS SIDE WHY DONT YOU . . . RAAAAAAAA I TRIED TO EXPLAINIT WAS MY OWN AUNTTHAT THERE WAS NO REASON NOT TO DO THAT, BUT YOU CANT SAY THAT TO ANYBODY WHOS SMART, WHO RUNS A HOTEL I LEARNED THERE THAT INNOVATION IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING IN THE REAL WORLD.WHO STOLE THE DOOR AT MIT THE DIFFERENT FRATERNITIES ALL HAD SMOKERS WHERE THEY TRIED TO GET THE NEW FRESHMEN TO BE THEIR PLEDGES, AND THE SUMMER BEFORE I WENT TO MIT I WAS INVITED TO A MEETING IN NEW YORK OF PHI BETA DELTA, A JEWISH FRATERNITY. IN THOSE DAYS, IF YOU WERE JEWISH OR BROUGHT UP IN A JEWISH FAMILY, YOU DIDNT HAVE A CHANCE IN ANY OTHER FRATERNITY. NOBODY ELSE WOULD LOOK AT YOU. I WASNT PARTICULARLY LOOKING TO BE WITH OTHER JEWS, AND THE GUYS FROM THE PHI BETA DELTA FRATERNITY DIDNT CARE HOW JEWISH I WASIN FACT, I DIDNT BELIEVE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT STUFF, AND WAS CERTAINLY NOT IN ANY WAY RELIGIOUS. ANYWAY, SOME GUYS FROM THE FRATERNITY ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS AND GAVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICETHAT I OUGHT TO TAKE THE FIRSTYEAR CALCULUS EXAM SO I WOULDNT HAVE TO TAKE THE COURSEWHICH TURNED OUT TO BE GOOD ADVICE. I LIKED THE FELLAS WHO CAME DOWN TO NEW YORK FROM THE FRATERNITY, AND THE TWO GUYS WHO TALKED ME INTO IT, I LATER BECAME THEIR ROOMMATE. THERE WAS ANOTHER JEWISH FRATERNITY AT MIT, CALLED SAM, AND THEIR IDEA WAS TO GIVE ME A RIDE UP TO BOSTON AND I COULD STAY WITH THEM. I ACCEPTED THE RIDE, AND STAYED UPSTAIRS IN ONE OF THE ROOMS THAT FIRST NIGHT. THE NEXT MORNING I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND SAW THE TWO GUYS FROM THE OTHER FRATERNITY THAT I MET IN NEW YORK WALKING UP THE STEPS. SOME GUYS FROM THE SIGMA ALPHA MU RAN OUT TO TALK TO THEM AND THERE WAS A BIG DISCUSSION. I YELLED OUT THE WINDOW, HEY, IM SUPPOSED TO BE WITH THOSE GUYS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE FRATERNITY WITHOUT REALIZING THAT THEY WERE ALL OPERATING, COMPETING FOR MY PLEDGE. I DIDNT HAVE ANY FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE FOR THE RIDE, OR ANYTHING. THE PHI BETA DELTA FRATERNITY HAD ALMOST COLLAPSED THE YEAR BEFORE, BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT CLIQUES THAT HAD SPLIT THE FRATERNITY IN HALF. THERE WAS A GROUP OF SOCIALITE CHARACTERS, WHO LIKED TO HAVE DANCES AND FOOL AROUND IN THEIR CARS AFTERWARDS, AND SO ON, AND THERE WAS A GROUP OF GUYS WHO DID NOTHING BUT STUDY, AND NEVER WENT TO THE DANCES. JUST BEFORE I CAME TO THE FRATERNITY THEY HAD HAD A BIG MEETING AND HAD MADE AN IMPORTANT COMPROMISE. THEY WERE GOING TO GET TOGETHER AND HELP EACH OTHER OUT. EVERYONE HAD TO HAVE A GRADE LEVEL OF AT LEAST SUCHANDSUCH. IF THEY WERE SLIDING BEHIND, THE GUYS WHO STUDIED ALL THE TIME WOULD TEACH THEM AND HELP THEM DO THEIR WORK. ON THE OTHER SIDE, EVERYBODY HAD TO GO TO EVERY DANCE. IF A GUY DIDNT KNOW HOW TO GET A DATE, THE OTHER GUYS WOULD GET HIM A DATE. IF THE GUY DIDNT KNOW HOW TO DANCE, THEYD TEACH HIM TO DANCE. ONE GROUP WAS TEACHING THE OTHER HOW TO THINK, WHILE THE OTHER GUYS WERE TEACHING THEM HOW TO BE SOCIAL. THAT WAS JUST RIGHT FOR ME, BECAUSE I WAS NOT VERY GOOD SOCIALLY. I WAS SO TIMID THAT WHEN I HAD TO TAKE THE MAIL OUT AND WALK PAST SOME SENIORS SITTING ON THE STEPS WITH SOME GIRLS, I WAS PETRIFIED I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO WALK PAST THEM AND IT DIDNT HELP ANY WHEN A GIRL WOULD SAY, OH, HES CUTE IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SOPHOMORES BROUGHT THEIR GIRLFRIENDS AND THEIR GIRLFRIENDS FRIENDS OVER TO TEACH US TO DANCE. MUCH LATER, ONE OF THE GUYS TAUGHT ME HOW TO DRIVE HIS CAR. THEY WORKED VERY HARD TO GET US INTELLECTUAL CHARACTERS TO SOCIALIZE AND BE MORE RELAXED, AND VICE VERSA. IT WAS A GOOD BALANCING OUT. I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING WHAT EXACTLY IT MEANT TO BE SOCIAL. SOON AFTER THESE SOCIAL GUYS HAD TAUGHT ME HOW TO MEET GIRLS, I SAW A NICE WAITRESS IN A RESTAURANT WHERE I WAS EATING BY MYSELF ONE DAY. WITH GREAT EFFORT I FINALLY GOT UP ENOUGH NERVE TO ASK HER TO BE MY DATE AT THE NEXT FRATERNITY DANCE, AND SHE SAID YES.BACK AT THE FRATERNITY, WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DATES FOR THE NEXT DANCE, I TOLD THE GUYS I DIDNT NEED A DATE THIS TIMEI HAD FOUND ONE ON MY OWN. I WAS VERY PROUD OF MYSELF. WHEN THE UPPERCLASSMEN FOUND OUT MY DATE WAS A WAITRESS, THEY WERE HORRIFIED. THEY TOLD ME THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THEY WOULD GET ME A PROPER DATE. THEY MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH I HAD STRAYED, THAT I WAS AMISS. THEY DECIDED TO TAKE OVER THE SITUATION. THEY WENT TO THE RESTAURANT, FOUND THE WAITRESS, TALKED HER OUT OF IT, AND GOT ME ANOTHER GIRL. THEY WERE TRYING TO EDUCATE THEIR WAYWARD SON, SO TO SPEAK, BUT THEY WERE WRONG, I THINK. I WAS ONLY A FRESHMAN THEN, AND I DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE YET TO STOP THEM FROM BREAKING MY DATE. WHEN I BECAME A PLEDGE THEY HAD VARIOUS WAYS OF HAZING. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID WAS TO TAKE US, BLINDFOLDED, FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE IN THE DEAD OF WINTER AND LEAVE US BY A FROZEN LAKE ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET APART. WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF ABSOLUTELY NOWHERENO HOUSES, NO NOTHINGAND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO FIND OUR WAY BACK TO THE FRATERNITY. WE WERE A LITTLE BIT SCARED, BECAUSE WE WERE YOUNG, AND WE DIDNT SAY MUCHEXCEPT FOR ONE GUY, WHOSE NAME WAS MAURICE MEYER YOU COULDNT STOP HIM FROM JOKING AROUND, MAKING DUMB PUNS, AND HAVING THIS HAPPYGOLUCKY ATTITUDE OF HA, HA, THERES NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. ISNT THIS FUN WE WERE GETTING MAD AT MAURICE. HE WAS ALWAYS WALKING A LITTLE BIT BEHIND AND LAUGHING AT THE WHOLE SITUATION, WHILE THE REST OF US DIDNT KNOW HOW WE WERE EVER GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS. WE CAME TO AN INTERSECTION NOT FAR FROM THE LAKETHERE WERE STILL NO HOUSES OR ANYTHINGAND THE REST OF US WERE DISCUSSING WHETHER WE SHOULD GO THIS WAY OR THAT WAY, WHEN MAURICE CAUGHT UP TO US AND SAID, GO THIS WAY. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW, MAURICE WE SAID, FRUSTRATED. YOURE ALWAYS MAKING THESE JOKES. WHY SHOULD WE GO THIS WAY SIMPLE LOOK AT THE TELEPHONE LINES. WHERE THERES MORE WIRES, ITS GOING TOWARD THE CENTRAL STATION. THIS GUY, WHO LOOKED LIKE HE WASNT PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYTHING, HAD COME UP WITH A TERRIFIC IDEA WE WALKED STRAIGHT INTO TOWN WITHOUT MAKING AN ERROR. ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A SCHOOL WIDE FRESHMAN VERSUS SOPHOMORE MUDEO VARIOUS FORMS OF WRESTLING AND TUG OF WARS THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE MUD. LATE IN THE EVENING, INTO OUR FRATERNITY COMES A WHOLE BUNCH OF SOPHOMORESSOME FROM OUR FRATERNITY AND SOME FROM OUTSIDE AND THEY KIDNAP US THEY WANT US TO BE TIRED THE NEXT DAY SO THEY CAN WIN. THE SOPHOMORES TIED UP ALL THE FRESHMEN RELATIVELY EASILYEXCEPT ME. I DIDNT WANT THE GUYS IN THE FRATERNITY TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS A SISSY. I WAS NEVER ANY GOOD IN SPORTS. I WAS ALWAYS TERRIFIED IF A TENNIS BALL WOULD COME OVER THE FENCE AND LAND NEAR ME, BECAUSE I NEVER COULD GET IT OVER THE FENCEIT USUALLY WENT ABOUT A RADIAN OFF OF WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO. I FIGURED THIS WAS A NEW SITUATION, A NEW WORLD, AND I COULD MAKE A NEW REPUTATION. SO IN ORDER THAT I WOULDNT LOOK LIKE I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT, I FOUGHT LIKE A SON OF A GUN AS BEST I COULD NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS DOING, AND IT TOOK THREE OR FOUR GUYS MANY TRIES BEFORE THEY WERE FINALLY ABLE TO TIE ME UP. THE SOPHOMORES TOOK US TO A HOUSE, FAR AWAY IN THE WOODS, AND TIED US ALL DOWN TO A WOODEN FLOOR WITH BIG U TACKS. I TRIED ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO ESCAPE, BUT THERE WERE SOPHOMORES GUARDING US, AND NONE OF MY TRICKS WORKED. I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY ONE YOUNG MAN THEY WERE AFRAID TO TIE DOWN BECAUSE HE WAS SO TERRIFIED HIS FACE WAS PALE YELLOW GREEN AND HE WAS SHAKING. I FOUND OUT LATER HE WAS FROM EUROPETHIS WAS IN THE EARLY THIRTIESAND HE DIDNT REALIZE THAT THESE GUYS ALL TIED DOWN TO THE FLOOR WAS SOME KIND OF A JOKE HE KNEW WHAT KINDS OF THINGS WERE GOING ON IN EUROPE. THE GUY WAS FRIGHTENING TO LOOK AT, HE WAS SO SCARED. BY THE TIME THE NIGHT WAS OVER, THERE WERE ONLY THREE SOPHOMORES GUARDING TWENTY OF US FRESHMEN, BUT WE DIDNT KNOW THAT. THE SOPHOMORES HAD DRIVEN THEIR CARS IN AND OUT A FEW TIMES TO MAKE IT SOUND AS IF THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTIVITY, AND WE DIDNT NOTICE IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME CARS AND THE SAME PEOPLE. SO WE DIDNT WIN THAT ONE. MY FATHER AND MOTHER HAPPENED TO COME UP THAT MORNING TO SEE HOW THEIR SON WAS DOING IN BOSTON, AND THE FRATERNITY KEPT PUTTING THEM OFF UNTIL WE CAME BACK FROM BEING KIDNAPPED. I WAS SO BEDRAGGLED AND DIRTY FROM STRUGGLING SO HARD TO ESCAPE AND FROM LACK OF SLEEP THAT THEY WERE REALLY HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER WHAT THEIR SON LOOKED LIKE AT MIT I HAD ALSO GOTTEN A STIFF NECK, AND I REMEMBER STANDING IN LINE FOR INSPECTION THAT AFTERNOON AT ROTC, NOT BEING ABLE TO LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD. THE COMMANDER GRABBED MY HEAD AND TURNED IT, SHOUTING, STRAIGHTEN UP I WINCED, AS MY SHOULDERS WENT AT AN ANGLE I CANT HELP IT, SIR OH, EXCUSE ME HE SAID, APOLOGETICALLY. ANYWAY, THE FACT THAT I FOUGHT SO LONG AND HARD NOT TO BE TIED UP GAVE ME A TERRIFIC REPUTATION, AND I NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SISSY BUSINESS AGAINA TREMENDOUS RELIEF. I OFTEN LISTENED TO MY ROOMMATESTHEY WERE BOTH SENIORSSTUDYING FOR THEIR THEORETICAL PHYSICS COURSE. ONE DAY THEY WERE WORKING PRETTY HARD ON SOMETHING THAT SEEMED PRETTY CLEAR TO ME, SO I SAID, WHY DONT YOU USE THE BERNOULLIS EQUATION WHATS THAT THEY EXCLAIMED. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I EXPLAINED TO THEM WHAT I MEANT AND HOW IT WORKED IN THIS CASE, AND IT SOLVED THE PROBLEM. IT TURNED OUT IT WAS BERNOULLIS EQUATION THAT I MEANT, BUT I HAD READ ALL THIS STUFF IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA WITHOUT TALKING TO ANYBODY ABOUT IT, SO I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE ANYTHING. BUT MY ROOMMATES WERE VERY EXCITED, AND FROM THEN ON THEY DISCUSSED THEIR PHYSICS PROBLEMS WITH MEI WASNT SO LUCKY WITH MANY OF THEMAND THE NEXT YEAR, WHEN I TOOK THE COURSE, I ADVANCED RAPIDLY. THAT WAS A VERY GOOD WAY TO GET EDUCATED, WORKING ON THE SENIOR PROBLEMS AND LEARNING HOW TO PRONOUNCE THINGS. I LIKED TO GO TO A PLACE CALLED THE RAYMOR AND PLAYMORE BALLROOMTWO BALLROOMS THAT WERE CONNECTED TOGETHERON TUESDAY NIGHTS. MY FRATERNITY BROTHERS DIDNT GO TO THESE OPEN DANCES THEY PREFERRED THEIR OWN DANCES, WHERE THE GIRLS THEY BROUGHT WERE UPPER CRUST ONES THEY HAD MET PROPERLY. I DIDNT CARE, WHEN I MET SOMEBODY, WHERE THEY WERE FROM, OR WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND WAS, SO I WOULD GO TO THESE DANCESEVEN THOUGH MY FRATERNITY BROTHERS DISAPPROVED I WAS A JUNIOR BY THIS TIME, AND THEY COULDNT STOP MEAND I HAD A VERY GOOD TIME. ONE TIME I DANCED WITH A CERTAIN GIRL A FEW TIMES, AND DIDNT SAY MUCH. FINALLY, SHE SAID TO ME, WHO HANTS VEWWY NICEEE. I COULDNT QUITE MAKE IT OUTSHE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN SPEECHBUT I THOUGHT SHE SAID, YOU DANCE VERY NICELY. THANK YOU, I SAID. ITS BEEN AN HONOR.WE WENT OVER TO A TABLE WHERE A FRIEND OF HERS HAD FOUND A BOY SHE WAS DANCING WITH AND WE SAT, THE FOUR OF US, TOGETHER. ONE GIRL WAS VERY HARD OF HEARING, AND THE OTHER GIRL WAS NEARLY DEAF. WHEN THE TWO GIRLS CONVERSED THEY WOULD DO A LARGE AMOUNT OF SIGNALING VERY RAPIDLY BACK AND FORTH, AND GRUNT A LITTLE BIT. IT DIDNT BOTHER ME THE GIRL DANCED WELL, AND SHE WAS A NICE PERSON. AFTER A FEW MORE DANCES, WERE SITTING AT THE TABLE AGAIN, AND THERES A LARGE AMOUNT OF SIGNALING BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH, UNTIL FINALLY SHE SAYS SOMETHING TO ME WHICH I GATHERED MEANS, SHED LIKE US TO TAKE THEM TO SOME HOTEL. I ASK THE OTHER GUY IF HE WANTS TO GO. WHAT DO THEY WANT US TO GO TO THIS HOTEL FOR HE ASKS. HELL, I DONT KNOW. WE DIDNT TALK WELL ENOUGH BUT I DONT HAVE TO KNOW. ITS JUST FUN, SEEING WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN ITS AN ADVENTURE THE OTHER GUYS AFRAID, SO HE SAYS NO. SO I TAKE THE TWO GIRLS IN A TAXI TO THE HOTEL, AND DISCOVER THAT THERES A DANCE ORGANIZED BY THE DEAF AND DUMB, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. THEY ALL BELONGED TO A CLUB. IT TURNS OUT MANY OF THEM CAN FEEL THE RHYTHM ENOUGH TO DANCE TO THE MUSIC AND APPLAUD THE BAND AT THE END OF EACH NUMBER. IT WAS VERY, VERY INTERESTING I FELT AS IF I WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND COULDNT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE I COULD SPEAK, BUT NOBODY COULD HEAR ME. EVERYBODY WAS TALKING WITH SIGNS TO EVERYBODY ELSE, AND I COULDNT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING I ASKED MY GIRL TO TEACH ME SOME SIGNS AND I LEARNED A FEW, LIKE YOU LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, JUST FOR FUN. EVERYONE WAS SO HAPPY AND RELAXED WITH EACH OTHER, MAKING JOKES AND SMILING ALL THE TIME THEY DIDNT SEEM TO HAVE ANY REAL DIFFICULTY OF ANY KIND COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER. IT WAS THE SAME AS WITH ANY OTHER LANGUAGE, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING AS THEYRE MAKING SIGNS TO EACH OTHER, THEIR HEADS WERE ALWAYS TURNING FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER. I REALIZED WHAT THAT WAS. WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE A SIDE REMARK OR INTERRUPT YOU, HE CANT YELL, HEY, JACK HE CAN ONLY MAKE A SIGNAL, WHICH YOU WONT CATCH UNLESS YOURE IN THE HABIT OF LOOKING AROUND ALL THE TIME. THEY WERE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER. IT WAS MY PROBLEM TO BE COMFORTABLE. IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. THE DANCE WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME, AND WHEN IT CLOSED DOWN WE WENT TO A CAFETERIA. THEY WERE ALL ORDERING THINGS BY POINTING TO THEM. I REMEMBER SOMEBODY ASKING IN SIGNS, WHEREAREYOUFROM AND MY GIRL SPELLING OUT NEW YORK. I STILL REMEMBER A GUY SIGNING TO ME GOOD SPORTHE HOLDS HIS THUMB UP, AND THEN TOUCHES AN IMAGINARY LAPEL, FOR SPORT. ITS A NICE SYSTEM. EVERYBODY WAS SITTING AROUND, MAKING JOKES, AND GETTING ME INTO THEIR WORLD VERY NICELY. I WANTED TO BUY A BOTTLE OF MILK, SO I WENT UP TO THE GUY AT THE COUNTER AND MOUTHED THE WORD MILK WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. THE GUY DIDNT UNDERSTAND. I MADE THE SYMBOL FOR MILK, WHICH IS TWO FISTS MOVING AS IF YOURE MILKING A COW, AND HE DIDNT CATCH THAT EITHER. I TRIED TO POINT TO THE SIGN THAT SHOWED THE PRICE OF MILK, BUT HE STILL DIDNT CATCH ON. FINALLY, SOME STRANGER NEARBY ORDERED MILK, AND I POINTED TO IT. OH MILK HE SAID, AS I NODDED MY HEAD YES.HE HANDED ME THE BOTTLE, AND I SAID, THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU SON OF A GUN HE SAID, SMILING. I OFTEN LIKED TO PLAY TRICKS ON PEOPLE WHEN I WAS AT MIT. ONE TIME, IN MECHANICAL DRAWING CLASS, SOME JOKER PICKED UP A FRENCH CURVE A PIECE OF PLASTIC FOR DRAWING SMOOTH CURVESA CURLY, FUNNYLOOKING THING AND SAID, I WONDER IF THE CURVES ON THIS THING HAVE SOME SPECIAL FORMULA I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND SAID, SURE THEY DO. THE CURVES ARE VERY SPECIAL CURVES. LEMME SHOW YA, AND I PICKED UP MY FRENCH CURVE AND BEGAN TO TURN IT SLOWLY. THE FRENCH CURVE IS MADE SO THAT AT THE LOWEST POINT ON EACH CURVE, NO MATTER HOW YOU TURN IT, THE TANGENT IS HORIZONTAL. ALL THE GUYS IN THE CLASS WERE HOLDING THEIR FRENCH CURVE UP AT DIFFERENT ANGLES, HOLDING THEIR PENCIL UP TO IT AT THE LOWEST POINT AND LAYING IT ALONG, AND DISCOVERING THAT, SURE ENOUGH, THE TANGENT IS HORIZONTAL. THEY WERE ALL EXCITED BY THIS DISCOVERYEVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY GONE THROUGH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CALCULUS AND HAD ALREADY LEARNED THAT THE DERIVATIVE TANGENT OF THE MINIMUM LOWEST POINT OF ANY CURVE IS ZERO HORIZONTAL. THEY DIDNT PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. THEY DIDNT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY KNEW. I DONT KNOW WHATS THE MATTER WITH PEOPLE THEY DONT LEARN BY UNDERSTANDING THEY LEARN BY SOME OTHER WAYBY ROTE, OR SOMETHING. THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS SO FRAGILE I DID THE SAME KIND OF TRICK FOUR YEARS LATER AT PRINCETON WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH AN EXPERIENCED CHARACTER, AN ASSISTANT OF EINSTEIN, WHO WAS SURELY WORKING WITH GRAVITY ALL THE TIME. I GAVE HIM A PROBLEM YOU BLAST OFF IN A ROCKET WHICH HAS A CLOCK ON BOARD, AND THERES A CLOCK ON THE GROUND. THE IDEA IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE BACK WHEN THE CLOCK ON THE GROUND SAYS ONE HOUR HAS PASSED. NOW YOU WANT IT SO THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK, YOUR CLOCK IS AS FAR AHEAD AS POSSIBLE. ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN, IF YOU GO VERY HIGH, YOUR CLOCK WILL GO FASTER, BECAUSE THE HIGHER SOMETHING IS IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD, THE FASTER ITS CLOCK GOES. BUT IF YOU TRY TO GO TOO HIGH, SINCE YOUVE ONLY GOT AN HOUR, YOU HAVE TO GO SO FAST TO GET THERE THAT THE SPEED SLOWS YOUR CLOCK DOWN. SO YOU CANT GO TOO HIGH. THE QUESTION IS, EXACTLY WHAT PROGRAM OF SPEED AND HEIGHT SHOULD YOU MAKE SO THAT YOU GET THE MAXIMUM TIME ON YOUR CLOCK THIS ASSISTANT OF EINSTEIN WORKED ON IT FOR QUITE A BIT BEFORE HE REALIZED THAT THE ANSWER IS THE REAL MOTION OF MATTER. IF YOU SHOOT SOMETHING UP IN A NORMAL WAY, SO THAT THE TIME IT TAKES THE SHELL TO GO UP AND COME DOWN IS AN HOUR, THATS THE CORRECT MOTION. ITS THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF EINSTEINS GRAVITYTHAT IS, WHATS CALLED THE PROPER TIME IS AT A MAXIMUM FOR THE ACTUAL CURVE. BUT WHEN I PUT IT TO HIM, ABOUT A ROCKET WITH A CLOCK, HE DIDNT RECOGNIZE IT. IT WAS JUST LIKE THE GUYS IN MECHANICAL DRAWING CLASS, BUT THIS TIME IT WASNT DUMB FRESHMEN. SO THIS KIND OF FRAGILITY IS, IN FACT, FAIRLY COMMON, EVEN WITH MORE LEARNED PEOPLE. WHEN I WAS A JUNIOR OR SENIOR I USED TO EAT AT A CERTAIN RESTAURANT IN BOSTON. I WENT THERE BY MYSELF, OFTEN ON SUCCESSIVE EVENINGS. PEOPLE GOT TO KNOW ME, AND I HAD THE SAME WAITRESS ALL THE TIME. I NOTICED THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS IN A HURRY, RUSHING AROUND, SO ONE DAY, JUST FOR FUN, I LEFT MY TIP, WHICH WAS USUALLY TEN CENTS NORMAL FOR THOSE DAYS, IN TWO NICKELS, UNDER TWO GLASSES I FILLED EACH GLASS TO THE VERY TOP, DROPPED A NICKEL IN, AND WITH A CARD OVER IT, TURNED IT OVER SO IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN ON THE TABLE. THEN I SLIPPED OUT THE CARD NO WATER LEAKS OUT BECAUSE NO AIR CAN COME INTHE RIM IS TOO CLOSE TO THE TABLE FOR THAT.I PUT THE TIP UNDER TWO GLASSES BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE ALWAYS IN A HURRY. IF THE TIP WAS A DIME IN ONE GLASS, THE WAITRESS, IN HER HASTE TO GET THE TABLE READY FOR THE NEXT CUSTOMER, WOULD PICK UP THE GLASS, THE WATER WOULD SPILL OUT, AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT. BUT AFTER SHE DOES THAT WITH THE FIRST GLASS, WHAT THE HELL IS SHE GOING TO DO WITH THE SECOND ONE SHE CANT JUST HAVE THE NERVE TO LIFT IT UP NOW ON THE WAY OUT I SAID TO MY WAITRESS, BE CAREFUL, SUE. THERES SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THE GLASSES YOU GAVE ME THEYRE FILLED IN ON THE TOP, AND THERES A HOLE ON THE BOTTOM THE NEXT DAY I CAME BACK, AND I HAD A NEW WAITRESS. MY REGULAR WAITRESS WOULDNT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME. SUES VERY ANGRY AT YOU, MY NEW WAITRESS SAID. AFTER SHE PICKED UP THE FIRST GLASS AND WATER WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE, SHE CALLED THE BOSS OUT. THEY STUDIED IT A LITTLE BIT, BUT THEY COULDNT SPEND ALL DAY FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO, SO THEY FINALLY PICKED UP THE OTHER ONE, AND WATER WENT OUT AGAIN, ALL OVER THE FLOOR. IT WAS A TERRIBLE MESS SUE SLIPPED LATER IN THE WATER. THEYRE ALL MAD AT YOU. I LAUGHED. SHE SAID, ITS NOT FUNNY HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE DID THAT TO YOUWHAT WOULD YOU DO ID GET A SOUP PLATE AND THEN SLIDE THE GLASS VERY CAREFULLY OVER TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE, AND LET THE WATER RUN INTO THE SOUP PLATEIT DOESNT HAVE TO RUN ONTO THE FLOOR. THEN ID TAKE THE NICKEL OUT. OH, THATS A GOOOD IDEA, SHE SAID. THAT EVENING I LEFT MY TIP UNDER A COFFEE CUP, WHICH I LEFT UPSIDE DOWN ON THE TABLE. THE NEXT NIGHT I CAME AND I HAD THE SAME NEW WAITRESS. WHATS THE IDEA OF LEAVING THE CUP UPSIDE DOWN LAST TIME WELL, I THOUGHT THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE IN A HURRY, YOUD HAVE TO GO BACK INTO THE KITCHEN AND GET A SOUP PLATE THEN YOUD HAVE TO SLOOOOWLY AND CAREFULLY SLIDE THE CUP OVER TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE . . . I DID THAT, SHE COMPLAINED, BUT THERE WAS NO WATER IN IT MY MASTERPIECE OF MISCHIEF HAPPENED AT THE FRATERNITY. ONE MORNING I WOKE UP VERY EARLY, ABOUT FIVE OCLOCK, AND COULDNT GO BACK TO SLEEP, SO I WENT DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE SLEEPING ROOMS AND DISCOVERED SOME SIGNS HANGING ON STRINGS WHICH SAID THINGS LIKE DOOR DOOR WHO STOLE THE DOOR I SAW THAT SOMEONE HAD TAKEN A DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, AND IN ITS PLACE THEY HUNG A SIGN THAT SAID, PLEASE CLOSE THE DOORTHE SIGN THAT USED TO BE ON THE DOOR THAT WAS MISSING. I IMMEDIATELY FIGURED OUT WHAT THE IDEA WAS. IN THAT ROOM A GUY NAMED PETE BERNAYS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER GUYS LIKED TO WORK VERY HARD, AND ALWAYS WANTED IT QUIET. IF YOU WANDERED INTO THEIR ROOM LOOKING FOR SOMETHING, OR TO ASK THEM HOW THEY DID PROBLEM SUCH AND SUCH, WHEN YOU WOULD LEAVE YOU WOULD ALWAYS HEAR THESE GUYS SCREAM, PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN TIRED OF THIS, NO DOUBT, AND HAD TAKEN THE DOOR OFF. NOW THIS ROOM, IT SO HAPPENED, HAD TWO DOORS, THE WAY IT WAS BUILT, SO I GOT AN IDEA I TOOK THE OTHER DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, CARRIED IT DOWNSTAIRS, AND HID IT IN THE BASEMENT BEHIND THE OIL TANK. THEN I QUIETLY WENT BACK UPSTAIRS AND WENT TO BED.LATER IN THE MORNING I MADE BELIEVE I WOKE UP AND CAME DOWNSTAIRS A LITTLE LATE. THE OTHER GUYS WERE MILLING AROUND, AND PETE AND HIS FRIENDS WERE ALL UPSET THE DOORS TO THEIR ROOM WERE MISSING, AND THEY HAD TO STUDY, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. I WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS AND THEY SAID, FEYNMAN DID YOU TAKE THE DOORS OH, YEAH I SAID. I TOOK THE DOOR. YOU CAN SEE THE SCRATCHES ON MY KNUCKLES HERE, THAT I GOT WHEN MY HANDS SCRAPED AGAINST THE WALL AS I WAS CARRYING IT DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT. THEY WERENT SATISFIED WITH MY ANSWER IN FACT, THEY DIDNT BELIEVE ME. THE GUYS WHO TOOK THE FIRST DOOR HAD LEFT SO MANY CLUESTHE HANDWRITING ON THE SIGNS, FOR INSTANCETHAT THEY WERE SOON FOUND OUT. MY IDEA WAS THAT WHEN IT WAS FOUND OUT WHO STOLE THE FIRST DOOR, EVERYBODY WOULD THINK THEY ALSO STOLE THE OTHER DOOR. IT WORKED PERFECTLY THE GUYS WHO TOOK THE FIRST DOOR WERE PUMMELED AND TORTURED AND WORKED ON BY EVERYBODY, UNTIL FINALLY, WITH MUCH PAIN AND DIFFICULTY, THEY CONVINCED THEIR TORMENTORS THAT THEY HAD ONLY TAKEN ONE DOOR, UNBELIEVABLE AS IT MIGHT BE. I LISTENED TO ALL THIS, AND I WAS HAPPY. THE OTHER DOOR STAYED MISSING FOR A WHOLE WEEK, AND IT BECAME MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT TO THE GUYS WHO WERE TRYING TO STUDY IN THAT ROOM THAT THE OTHER DOOR BE FOUND. FINALLY, IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRATERNITY SAYS AT THE DINNER TABLE, WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM OF THE OTHER DOOR. I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM MYSELF, SO I WOULD LIKE SUGGESTIONS FROM THE REST OF YOU AS TO HOW TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT, BECAUSE PETE AND THE OTHERS ARE TRYING TO STUDY. SOMEBODY MAKES A SUGGESTION, THEN SOMEONE ELSE. AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, I GET UP AND MAKE A SUGGESTION. ALL RIGHT, I SAY IN A SARCASTIC VOICE, WHOEVER YOU ARE WHO STOLE THE DOOR, WE KNOW YOURE WONDERFUL. YOURE SO CLEVER WE CANT FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE, SO YOU MUST BE SOME SORT OF SUPERGENIUS. YOU DONT HAVE TO TELL US WHO YOU ARE ALL WE WANT TO KNOW IS WHERE THE DOOR IS. SO IF YOU WILL LEAVE A NOTE SOMEWHERE, TELLING US WHERE THE DOOR IS, WE WILL HONOR YOU AND ADMIT FOREVER THAT YOU ARE A SUPERMARVEL, THAT YOU ARE SO SMART THAT YOU COULD TAKE THE OTHER DOOR WITHOUT OUR BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE. BUT FOR GODS SAKE, JUST LEAVE THE NOTE SOMEWHERE, AND WE WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR IT. THE NEXT GUY MAKES HIS SUGGESTION I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA, HE SAYS. I THINK THAT YOU, AS PRESIDENT, SHOULD ASK EACH MAN ON HIS WORD OF HONOR TOWARDS THE FRATERNITY TO SAY WHETHER HE TOOK THE DOOR OR NOT. THE PRESIDENT SAYS, THATS A VERY GOOD IDEA. ON THE FRATERNITY WORD OF HONOR SO HE GOES AROUND THE TABLE, AND ASKS EACH GUY, ONE BY ONE JACK, DID YOU TAKE THE DOOR NO, SIR, I DID NOT TAKE THE DOOR. TIM DID YOU TAKE THE DOOR NO, SIR I DID NOT TAKE THE DOOR MAURICE. DID YOU TAKE THE DOOR NO, I DID NOT TAKE THE DOOR, SIR. FEYNMAN, DID YOU TAKE THE DOORYEAH, I TOOK THE DOOR. CUT IT OUT, FEYNMAN THIS IS SERIOUS SAM DID YOU TAKE THE DOOR . . . IT WENT ALL THE WAY AROUND. EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED. THERE MUST BE SOME REAL RAT IN THE FRATERNITY WHO DIDNT RESPECT THE FRATERNITY WORD OF HONOR THAT NIGHT I LEFT A NOTE WITH A LITTLE PICTURE OF THE OIL TANK AND THE DOOR NEXT TO IT, AND THE NEXT DAY THEY FOUND THE DOOR AND PUT IT BACK. SOMETIME LATER I FINALLY ADMITTED TO TAKING THE OTHER DOOR, AND I WAS ACCUSED BY EVERYBODY OF LYING. THEY COULDNT REMEMBER WHAT I HAD SAID. ALL THEY COULD REMEMBER WAS THEIR CONCLUSION AFTER THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRATERNITY HAD GONE AROUND THE TABLE AND ASKED EVERYBODY, THAT NOBODY ADMITTED TAKING THE DOOR. THE IDEA THEY REMEMBERED, BUT NOT THE WORDS. PEOPLE OFTEN THINK IM A FAKER, BUT IM USUALLY HONEST, IN A CERTAIN WAYIN SUCH A WAY THAT OFTEN NOBODY BELIEVES MELATIN OR ITALIAN THERE WAS AN ITALIAN RADIO STATION IN BROOKLYN, AND AS A BOY I USED TO LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME. I LOVED THE ROLLING SOUNDS GOING OVER ME, AS IF I WAS IN THE OCEAN, AND THE WAVES WERENT VERY HIGH. I USED TO SIT THERE AND HAVE THE WATER COME OVER ME, IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN. IN THE ITALIAN PROGRAMS THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME KIND OF FAMILY SITUATION WHERE THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS AND ARGUMENTS BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND FATHER HIGH VOICE NIO TECO TIETO CAPETO TUTTO . . . LOUD, LOW VOICE DRO TONE PALA TUTTO WITH HAND SLAPPING. IT WAS GREAT SO I LEARNED TO MAKE ALL THESE EMOTIONS I COULD CRY I COULD LAUGH ALL THIS STUFF. ITALIAN IS A LOVELY LANGUAGE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ITALIAN PEOPLE LIVING NEAR US IN NEW YORK. ONCE WHILE I WAS RIDING MY BICYCLE, SOME ITALIAN TRUCK DRIVER GOT UPSET AT ME, LEANED OUT OF HIS TRUCK, AND, GESTURING, YELLED SOMETHING LIKE, ME ARRUCHA LAMPE ETTA TICHE I FELT LIKE A CRAPPER. WHAT DID HE SAY TO ME WHAT SHOULD I YELL BACK SO I ASKED AN ITALIAN FRIEND OF MINE AT SCHOOL, AND HE SAID, JUST SAY, A TE A TEWHICH MEANS THE SAME TO YOU THE SAME TO YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA. I WOULD SAY A TE A TE BACKGESTURING, OF COURSE. THEN, AS I GAINED CONFIDENCE, I DEVELOPED MY ABILITIES FURTHER. I WOULD BE RIDING MY BICYCLE, AND SOME LADY WOULD BE DRIVING IN HER CAR AND GET IN THE WAY, AND ID SAY, PUZZIA A LA MALOCHEAND SHED SHRINK SOME TERRIBLE ITALIAN BOY HAD CURSED A TERRIBLE CURSE AT HER IT WAS NOT SO EASY TO RECOGNIZE IT AS FAKE ITALIAN. ONCE, WHEN I WAS AT PRINCETON, AS I WAS GOING INTO THE PARKING LOT AT PALMER LABORATORY ON MY BICYCLE, SOMEBODY GOT IN THE WAY. MY HABIT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME I GESTURE TO THE GUY, OREZZE CAB ONCA MICHE, SLAPPING THE BACK OF ONE HAND AGAINST THE OTHER. AND WAY UP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A LONG AREA OF GRASS, THERES AN ITALIAN GARDENER PUTTING IN SOME PLANTS. HE STOPS, WAVES, AND SHOUTS HAPPILY, REZZA MA LIA I CALL BACK, RONTE BALTA, RETURNING THE GREETING. HE DIDNT KNOW I DIDNT KNOW, AND I DIDNT KNOW WHAT HE SAID, AND HE DIDNT KNOW WHAT I SAID. BUT IT WAS OK IT WAS GREAT IT WORKS AFTER ALL, WHEN THEY HEAR THE INTONATION, THEY RECOGNIZE IT IMMEDIATELY AS ITALIANMAYBE ITS MILANO INSTEAD OF ROMANO, WHAT THE HELL. BUT HES AN ITALIAN SO ITS JUST GREAT. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE. KEEP RIGHT ON GOING, AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. ONE TIME I CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE FOR A VACATION, AND MY SISTER WAS SORT OF UNHAPPY, ALMOST CRYING HER GIRL SCOUTS WERE HAVING A FATHERDAUGHTER BANQUET, BUT OUR FATHER WAS OUT ON THE ROAD, SELLING UNIFORMS. SO I SAID I WOULD TAKE HER, BEING THE BROTHER IM NINE YEARS OLDER, SO IT WASNT SO CRAZY. WHEN WE GOT THERE, I SAT AMONG THE FATHERS FOR A WHILE, BUT SOON BECAME SICK OF THEM. ALL THESE FATHERS BRING THEIR DAUGHTERS TO THIS NICE LITTLE BANQUET, AND ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS THE STOCK MARKETTHEY DONT KNOW HOW TO TALK TO THEIR OWN CHILDREN, MUCH LESS THEIR CHILDRENS FRIENDS. DURING THE BANQUET THE GIRLS ENTERTAINED US BY DOING LITTLE SKITS, RECITING POETRY, AND SO ON. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY BRING OUT THIS FUNNYLOOKING APRON LIKE THING, WITH A HOLE AT THE TOP TO PUT YOUR HEAD THROUGH. THE GIRLS ANNOUNCE THAT THE FATHERS ARE NOW GOING TO ENTERTAIN THEM.SO EACH FATHER HAS TO GET UP AND STICK HIS HEAD THROUGH AND SAY SOMETHINGONE GUY RECITES MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMBAND THEY DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO EITHER, BUT BY THE TIME I GOT UP THERE, I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS GOING TO RECITE A LITTLE POEM, AND IM SORRY THAT ITS NOT IN ENGLISH, BUT IM SURE THEY WILL APPRECIATE IT ANYWAY A TUZZO LANTO POICI DI PARE TANTO SACA TULNA TI, NA PUTA TUCHI PUTI TI LA. RUNTO CATA CHANTO CHANTA MANTO CHI LA TI DA.

AFTER THE BANQUET WAS OVER, THE SCOUTMASTER AND A SCHOOLTEACHER CAME OVER AND TOLD ME THEY HAD BEEN DISCUSSING MY POEM. ONE OF THEM THOUGHT IT WAS ITALIAN, AND THE OTHER THOUGHT IT WAS LATIN. THE SCHOOLTEACHER ASKS, WHICH ONE OF US IS RIGHT I SAID, YOULL HAVE TO GO ASK THE GIRLSTHEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT LANGUAGE IT WAS RIGHT AWAY.ALWAYS TRYING TO ESCAPE WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT MIT I WAS INTERESTED ONLY IN SCIENCE I WAS NO GOOD AT ANYTHING ELSE. BUT AT MIT THERE WAS A RULE YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME HUMANITIES COURSES TO GET MORE CULTURE. BESIDES THE ENGLISH CLASSES REQUIRED WERE TWO ELECTIVES, SO I LOOKED THROUGH THE LIST, AND RIGHT AWAY I FOUND ASTRONOMYAS A HUMANITIES COURSE SO THAT YEAR I ESCAPED WITH ASTRONOMY. THEN NEXT YEAR I LOOKED FURTHER DOWN THE LIST, PAST FRENCH LITERATURE AND COURSES LIKE THAT, AND FOUND PHILOSOPHY. IT WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO SCIENCE I COULD FIND. BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED IN PHILOSOPHY, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE ENGLISH CLASS. WE HAD TO WRITE A NUMBER OF THEMES. FOR INSTANCE, MILL HAD WRITTEN SOMETHING ON LIBERTY, AND WE HAD TO CRITICIZE IT. BUT INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING MYSELF TO POLITICAL LIBERTY, AS MILL DID, I WROTE ABOUT LIBERTY IN SOCIAL OCCASIONSTHE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO FAKE AND LIE IN ORDER TO BE POLITE, AND DOES THIS PERPETUAL GAME OF FAKING IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MORAL FIBER OF SOCIETY. AN INTERESTING QUESTION, BUT NOT THE ONE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS. ANOTHER ESSAY WE HAD TO CRITICIZE WAS BY HUXLEY, ON A PIECE OF CHALK, IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES HOW AN ORDINARY PIECE OF CHALK HE IS HOLDING IS THE REMAINS FROM ANIMAL BONES, AND THE FORCES INSIDE THE EARTH LIFTED IT UP SO THAT IT BECAME PART OF THE WHITE CLIFFS, AND THEN IT WAS QUARRIED AND IS NOW USED TO CONVE IDEAS THROUGH WRITING ON THE BLACKBOARD. BUT AGAIN, INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING THE ESSAY ASSIGNED TO US, I WROTE A PARODY CALLED, ON A PIECE OF DUST, ABOUT HOW DUST MAKES THE COLORS OF THE SUNSET AND PRECIPITATES THE RAIN, AND SO ON. I WAS ALWAYS A FAKER, ALWAYS TRYING TO ESCAPE. BUT WHEN WE HAD TO WRITE A THEME ON GOETHES FAUST, IT WAS HOPELESS THE WORK WAS TOO LONG TO MAKE A PARODY OF IT OR TO INVENT SOMETHING ELSE. I WAS STORMING BACK AND FORTH IN THE FRATERNITY SAYING, I CANT DO IT. IM JUST NOT GONNA DO IT. I AINT GONNA DO IT ONE OF MY FRATERNITY BROTHERS SAID, OK, FEYNMAN, YOURE NOT GONNA DO IT. BUT THE PROFESSOR WILL THINK YOU DIDNT DO IT BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT TO DO THE WORK. YOU OUGHTA WRITE A THEME ON SOMETHINGSAME NUMBER OF WORDSAND HAND IT IN WITH A NOTE SAYING THAT YOU JUST COULDNT UNDERSTAND THE FAUST, YOU HAVENT GOT THE HEART FOR IT, AND THAT ITS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO WRITE A THEME ON IT. SO I DID THAT. I WROTE A LONG THEME, ON THE LIMITATIONS OF REASON. I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS, AND HOW THERE ARE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS MORAL VALUES CANNOT BE DECIDED BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS, YAK, YAK, YAK, AND SO ON. THEN ANOTHER FRATERNITY BROTHER OFFERED SOME MORE ADVICE. FEYNMAN, HE SAID, IT AINT GONNA WORK, HANDING IN A THEME THATS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH FAUST. WHAT YOU OUGHTA DO IS WORK THAT THING YOU WROTE INTO THE FAUST. RIDICULOUS I SAID. BUT THE OTHER FRATERNITY GUYS THINK ITS A GOOD IDEA. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT I SAY, PROTESTING. ILL TRY. SO I ADDED HALF A PAGE TO WHAT  HAD ALREADY WRITTEN, AND SAID THAT MEPHISTOPHELES REPRESENTS REASON, AND FAUST REPRESENTS THE SPIRIT, AND GOETHE IS TRYING TO SHOW THE LIMITATIONS OF REASON. I STIRRED IT UP, CRANKED IT ALL IN, AND HANDED IN MY THEME.THE PROFESSOR HAD US EACH COME IN INDIVIDUALLY TO DISCUSS OUR THEME. I WENT IN EXPECTING THE WORST. HE SAID, THE INTRODUCTORY MATERIAL IS FINE, BUT THE FAUST MATERIAL IS A BIT TOO BRIEF. OTHERWISE, ITS VERY GOOD B  . I ESCAPED AGAIN NOW TO THE PHILOSOPHY CLASS. THE COURSE WAS TAUGHT BY AN OLD BEARDED PROFESSOR NAMED ROBINSON, WHO ALWAYS MUMBLED. I WOULD GO TO THE CLASS, AND HE WOULD MUMBLE ALONG, AND I COULDNT UNDERSTAND A THING. THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CLASS SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER, BUT THEY DIDNT SEEM TO PAY ANY ATTENTION. I HAPPENED TO HAVE A SMALL DRILL, ABOUT ONESIXTEENTHINCH, AND TO PASS THE TIME IN THAT CLASS, I WOULD TWIST IT BETWEEN MY FINGERS AND DRILL HOLES IN THE SOLE OF MY SHOE, WEEK AFTER WEEK. FINALLY ONE DAY AT THE END OF THE CLASS, PROFESSOR ROBINSON WENT WUGGA MUGGA MUGGA WUGGA WUGGA . . . AND EVERYBODY GOT EXCITED THEY WERE ALL TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND DISCUSSING, SO I FIGURED HED SAID SOMETHING INTERESTING, THANK GOD I WONDERED WHAT IT WAS I ASKED SOMEBODY, AND THEY SAID, WE HAVE TO WRITE A THEME, AND HAND IT IN IN FOUR WEEKS. A THEME ON WHAT ON WHAT HES BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL YEAR. I WAS STUCK. THE ONLY THING THAT I HAD HEARD DURING THAT ENTIRE TERM THAT I COULD REMEMBER WAS A MOMENT WHEN THERE CAME THIS UPWELLING, MUGGAWUGGASTREAMOFCONSCIOUSNESSMUGGA WUGGA, AND PHOOMIT SANK BACK INTO CHAOS. THIS STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS REMINDED ME OF A PROBLEM MY FATHER HAD GIVEN TO ME MANY YEARS BEFORE. HE SAID, SUPPOSE SOME MARTIANS WERE TO COME DOWN TO EARTH, AND MARTIANS NEVER SLEPT, BUT INSTEAD WERE PERPETUALLY ACTIVE. SUPPOSE THEY DIDNT HAVE THIS CRAZY PHENOMENON THAT WE HAVE, CALLED SLEEP. SO THEY ASK YOU THE QUESTION HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GO TO SLEEP WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP DO YOUR THOUGHTS SUDDENLY STOP, OR DO THEY MOVE LESS AANNDD LLEEESSSS RRAAAAAPPPPPIIDDDDDLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY YYY HOW DOES THE MIND ACTUALLY TURN OFF I GOT INTERESTED. NOW I HAD TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION HOW DOES THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS END, WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP SO EVERY AFTERNOON FOR THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS I WOULD WORK ON MY THEME, I WOULD PULL DOWN THE SHADES IN MY ROOM, TURN OFF THE LIGHTS, AND GO TO SLEEP. AND ID WATCH WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP. THEN AT NIGHT, ID GO TO SLEEP AGAIN, SO I HAD TWO TIMES EACH DAY WHEN I COULD MAKE OBSERVATIONSIT WAS VERY GOOD AT FIRST I NOTICED A LOT OF SUBSIDIARY THINGS THAT HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH FALLING ASLEEP. I NOTICED, FOR INSTANCE, THAT I DID A LOT OF THINKING BY SPEAKING TO MYSELF INTERNALLY. I COULD ALSO IMAGINE THINGS VISUALLY. THEN, WHEN I WAS GETTING TIRED, I NOTICED THAT I COULD THINK OF TWO THINGS AT ONCE. I DISCOVERED THIS WHEN I WAS TALKING INTERNALLY TO MYSELF ABOUT SOMETHING, AND WHILE I WAS DOING THIS, I WAS IDLY IMAGINING TWO ROPES CONNECTED TO THE END OF MY BED, GOING THROUGH SOME PULLEYS, AND WINDING AROUND A TURNING CYLINDER, SLOWLY LIFTING THE BED. I WASNT AWARE THAT I WAS IMAGINING THESE ROPES UNTIL I BEGAN TO WORRY THAT ONE ROPE WOULD CATCH ON THE OTHER ROPE, AND THEY WOULDNT WIND UPSMOOTHLY. BUT I SAID, INTERNALLY, OH, THE TENSION WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT, AND THIS INTERRUPTED THE FIRST THOUGHT I WAS HAVING, AND MADE ME AWARE THAT I WAS THINKING OF TWO THINGS AT ONCE. I ALSO NOTICED THAT AS YOU GO TO SLEEP THE IDEAS CONTINUE, BUT THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS LOGICALLY INTERCONNECTED. YOU DONT NOTICE THAT THEYRE NOT LOGICALLY CONNECTED UNTIL YOU ASK YOURSELF, WHAT MADE ME THINK OF THAT AND YOU TRY TO WORK YOUR WAY BACK, AND OFTEN YOU CANT REMEMBER WHAT THE HELL DID MAKE YOU THINK OF THAT SO YOU GET EVERY ILLUSION OF LOGICAL CONNECTION, BUT THE ACTUAL FACT IS THAT THE THOUGHTS BECOME MORE AND MORE COCKEYED UNTIL THEYRE COMPLETELY DISJOINTED, AND BEYOND THAT, YOU FALL ASLEEP. AFTER FOUR WEEKS OF SLEEPING ALL THE TIME, I WROTE MY THEME, AND EXPLAINED THE OBSERVATIONS I HAD MADE. AT THE END OF THE THEME I POINTED OUT THAT ALL OF THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE WHILE I WAS WATCHING MYSELF FALL ASLEEP, AND I DONT REALLY KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE TO FALL ASLEEP WHEN IM NOT WATCHING MYSELF. I CONCLUDED THE THEME WITH A LITTLE VERSE I MADE UP, WHICH POINTED OUT THIS PROBLEM OF INTROSPECTION I WONDER WHY. I WONDER WHY. I WONDER WHY I WONDER. I WONDER WHY I WONDER WHY I WONDER WHY I WONDER WE HAND IN OUR THEMES, AND THE NEXT TIME OUR CLASS MEETS, THE PROFESSOR READS ONE OF THEM MUM BUM WUGGA MUM BUM . . . I CANT TELL WHAT THE GUY WROTE. HE READS ANOTHER THEME MUGGA WUGGA MUM BUM WUGGA WUGGA. . . I DONT KNOW WHAT THAT GUY WROTE EITHER, BUT AT THE END OF IT, HE GOES UH WUGGA WUH. UH WUGGA WUH UH WUGGA WUGGA WUGGA. I WUGGA WUH UH WUGGA WUH UH WUGGA WUGGA WUGGA. AHA I SAY. THATS MY THEME I HONESTLY DIDNT RECOGNIZE IT UNTIL THE END. AFTER I HAD WRITTEN THE THEME I CONTINUED TO BE CURIOUS, AND I KEPT PRACTICING THIS WATCHING MYSELF AS I WENT TO SLEEP. ONE NIGHT, WHILE I WAS HAVING A DREAM, I REALIZED I WAS OBSERVING MYSELF IN THE DREAM. I HAD GOTTEN ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE SLEEP ITSELF IN THE FIRST PART OF THE DREAM IM ON TOP OF A TRAIN AND WERE APPROACHING A TUNNEL. I GET SCARED, PULL MYSELF DOWN, AND WE GO INTO THE TUNNELWHOOSH I SAY TO MYSELF, SO YOU CAN GET THE FEELING OF FEAR, AND YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND CHANGE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE TUNNEL. I ALSO NOTICED THAT I COULD SEE COLORS. SOME PEOPLE HAD SAID THAT YOU DREAM IN BLACK AND WHITE, BUT NO, I WAS DREAMING IN COLOR. BY THIS TIME I WAS INSIDE ONE OF THE TRAIN CARS, AND I CAN FEEL THE TRAIN LURCHING ABOUT. I SAY TO MYSELF, SO YOU CAN GET KINESTHETIC FEELINGS IN A DREAM. I WALK WITH SOME DIFFICULTY DOWN TO THE END OF THE CAR, AND I SEE A BIG WINDOW, LIKE A STORE WINDOW. BEHIND IT THERE ARENOT MANNEQUINS, BUT THREE LIVE GIRLS IN BATHING SUITS, AND THEY LOOK PRETTY GOODI CONTINUE WALKING INTO THE NEXT CAR, HANGING ONTO THE STRAPS OVERHEAD AS I GO, WHEN I SAY TO MYSELF, HEY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO GET EXCITEDSEXUALLYSO I THINK ILL GO BACK INTO THE OTHER CAR. I DISCOVERED THAT I COULD TURN AROUND, AND WALK BACK THROUGH THE TRAINI COULD CONTROL THE DIRECTION OF MY DREAM. I GET BACK TO THE CAR WITH THE SPECIAL WINDOW, AND I SEE THREE OLD GUYS PLAYING VIOLINSBUT THEY TURNED BACK INTO GIRLS SO I COULD MODIFY THE DIRECTION OF MY DREAM, BUT NOT PERFECTLY. WELL, I BEGAN TO GET EXCITED, INTELLECTUALLY AS WELL AS SEXUALLY, SAYING THINGS LIKE, WOW ITS WORKING AND I WOKE UP. I MADE SOME OTHER OBSERVATIONS WHILE DREAMING. APART FROM ALWAYS ASKING MYSELF, AM I REALLY DREAMING IN COLOR I WONDERED, HOW ACCURATELY DO YOU SEE SOMETHING THE NEXT TIME I HAD A DREAM, THERE WAS A GIRL LYING IN TALL GRASS, AND SHE HAD RED HAIR. I TRIED TO SEE IF I COULD SEE EACH HAIR. YOU KNOW HOW THERES A LITTLE AREA OF COLOR JUST WHERE THE SUN IS REFLECTINGTHE DIFFRACTION EFFECT, I COULD SEE THAT I COULD SEE EACH HAIR AS SHARP AS YOU WANT PERFECT VISION ANOTHER TIME I HAD A DREAM IN WHICH A THUMBTACK WAS STUCK IN A DOORFRAME. I SEE THE TACK, RUN MY FINGERS DOWN THE DOORFRAME, AND I FEEL THE TACK. SO THE SEEING DEPARTMENT AND THE FEELING DEPARTMENT OF THE BRAIN SEEM TO BE CONNECTED. THEN I SAY TO MYSELF, COULD IT BE THAT THEY DONT HAVE TO BE CONNECTED I LOOK AT THE DOORFRAME AGAIN, AND THERES NO THUMBTACK. I RUN MY FINGER DOWN THE DOORFRAME, AND I FEEL THE TACK ANOTHER TIME IM DREAMING AND I HEAR KNOCKKNOCK KNOCKKNOCK. SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING IN THE DREAM THAT MADE THIS KNOCKING FIT, BUT NOT PERFECTLYIT SEEMED SORT OF FOREIGN. I THOUGHT ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED THAT THIS KNOCKING IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE MY DREAM, AND IVE INVENTED THIS PART OF THE DREAM TO FIT WITH IT. IVE GOT TO WAKE UP AND FIND OUT WHAT THE HELL IT IS. THE KNOCKING IS STILL GOING, I WAKE UP, AND . . . DEAD SILENCE. THERE WAS NOTHING. SO IT WASNT CONNECTED TO THE OUTSIDE. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE INCORPORATED EXTERNAL NOISES INTO THEIR DREAMS, BUT WHEN I HAD THIS EXPERIENCE, CAREFULLY WATCHING FROM BELOW, AND SURE THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE DREAM, IT WASNT. DURING THE TIME OF MAKING OBSERVATIONS IN MY DREAMS, THE PROCESS OF WAKING UP WAS A RATHER FEARFUL ONE. AS YOURE BEGINNING TO WAKE UP THERES A MOMENT WHEN YOU FEEL RIGID AND TIED DOWN, OR UNDERNEATH MANY LAYERS OF COTTON BATTING. ITS HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT THERES A MOMENT WHEN YOU GET THE FEELING YOU CANT GET OUT YOURE NOT SURE YOU CAN WAKE UP. SO I WOULD HAVE TO TELL MYSELFAFTER I WAS AWAKETHAT THATS RIDICULOUS. THERES NO DISEASE I KNOW OF WHERE A PERSON FALLS ASLEEP NATURALLY AND CANT WAKE UP. YOU CAN ALWAYS WAKE UP. AND AFTER TALKING TO MYSELF MANY TIMES LIKE THAT, I BECAME LESS AND LESS AFRAID, AND IN FACT I FOUND THE PROCESS OF WAKING UP RATHER THRILLINGSOMETHING LIKE A ROLLER COASTER AFTER A WHILE YOURE NOT SO SCARED, AND YOU BEGIN TO ENJOY IT A LITTLE BIT. YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS PROCESS OF OBSERVING MY DREAMS STOPPED WHICH IT HAS FOR THE MOST PART ITS HAPPENED JUST A FEW TIMES SINCE. IM DREAMING ONE NIGHT AS USUAL, MAKING OBSERVATIONS, AND I SEE ON THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME A PENNANT. I ANSWER FOR THE TWENTYFIFTH TIME, YES, IM DREAMING IN COLOR, AND THEN I REALIZE THAT IVE BEEN SLEEPING WITH THE BACK OF MY HEAD AGAINST A BRASS ROD. I PUT MY HAND BEHIND MY HEAD AND I FEEL THAT THE BACK OF MY HEAD IS SOFT. I THINK, AHA THATS WHY IVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ALL THESE OBSERVATIONS IN MY DREAMS THE BRASS ROD HAS DISTURBEDMY VISUAL CORTEX. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SLEEP WITH A BRASS ROD UNDER MY HEAD, AND I CAN MAKE THESE OBSERVATIONS ANY TIME I WANT. SO I THINK ILL STOP MAKING OBSERVATIONS ON THIS ONE, AND GO INTO DEEPER SLEEP. WHEN I WOKE UP LATER, THERE WAS NO BRASS ROD, NOR WAS THE BACK OF MY HEAD SOFT. SOMEHOW I HAD BECOME TIRED OF MAKING THESE OBSERVATIONS, AND MY BRAIN HAD INVENTED SOME FALSE REASONS AS TO WHY I SHOULDNT DO IT ANY MORE. AS A RESULT OF THESE OBSERVATIONS I BEGAN TO GET A LITTLE THEORY. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I LIKED TO LOOK AT DREAMS WAS THAT I WAS CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOU CAN SEE AN IMAGE, OF A PERSON, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED, AND NOTHINGS COMING IN. YOU SAY IT MIGHT BE RANDOM, IRREGULAR NERVE DISCHARGES, BUT YOU CANT GET THE NERVES TO DISCHARGE IN EXACTLY THE SAME DELICATE PATTERNS WHEN YOU ARE SLEEPING AS WHEN YOU ARE AWAKE, LOOKING AT SOMETHING. WELL THEN, HOW COULD I SEE IN COLOR, AND IN BETTER DETAIL, WHEN I WAS ASLEEP I DECIDED THERE MUST BE AN INTERPRETATION DEPARTMENT. WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT SOMETHINGA MAN, A LAMP, OR A WALLYOU DONT JUST SEE BLOTCHES OF COLOR. SOMETHING TELLS YOU WHAT IT IS IT HAS TO BE INTERPRETED. WHEN YOURE DREAMING, THIS INTERPRETATION DEPARTMENT IS STILL OPERATING, BUT ITS ALL SLOPPED UP. ITS TELLING YOU THAT YOURE SEEING A HUMAN HAIR IN THE GREATEST DETAIL, WHEN IT ISNT TRUE. ITS INTERPRETING THE RANDOM JUNK ENTERING THE BRAIN AS A CLEAR IMAGE. ONE OTHER THING ABOUT DREAMS. I HAD A FRIEND NAMED DEUTSCH, WHOSE WIFE WAS FROM A FAMILY OF PSYCHOANALYSTS IN VIENNA. ONE EVENING, DURING A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT DREAMS, HE TOLD ME THAT DREAMS HAVE SIGNIFICANCE THERE ARE SYMBOLS IN DREAMS THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED PSYCHOANALYTICALLY. I DIDNT BELIEVE MOST OF THIS STUFF, BUT THAT NIGHT I HAD AN INTERESTING DREAM WERE PLAYING A GAME ON A BILLIARD TABLE WITH THREE BALLSA WHITE BALL, A GREEN BALL, AND A GRAY BALLAND THE NAME OF THE GAME IS TITSIES. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT TRYING TO GET THE BALLS INTO THE POCKET THE WHITE BALL AND THE GREEN BALL ARE EASY TO SINK INTO THE POCKET, BUT THE GRAY ONE, I CANT GET TO IT. I WAKE UP, AND THE DREAM IS VERY EASY TO INTERPRET THE NAME OF THE GAME GIVES IT AWAY, OF COURSETHEMS GIRLS THE WHITE BALL WAS EASY TO FIGURE OUT, BECAUSE I WAS GOING OUT, SNEAKILY, WITH A MARRIED WOMAN WHO WORKED AT THE TIME AS A CASHIER IN A CAFETERIA AND WORE A WHITE UNIFORM. THE GREEN ONE WAS ALSO EASY, BECAUSE I HAD GONE OUT ABOUT TWO NIGHTS BEFORE TO A DRIVEIN MOVIE WITH A GIRL IN A GREEN DRESS. BUT THE GRAY ONEWHAT THE HELL WAS THE GRAY ONE I KNEW IT HAD TO BE SOMEBODY I FELT IT. ITS LIKE WHEN YOURE TRYING TO REMEMBER A NAME, AND ITS ON THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE, HUT YOU CANT GET IT. IT TOOK ME HALF A DAY BEFORE I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD SAID GOODBYE TO A GIRL I LIKED VERY MUCH, WHO HAD GONE TO ITALY ABOUT TWO OR THREE MONTHS BEFORE. SHE WAS A VERY NICE GIRL, AND I HAD DECIDED THAT WHEN SHE CAME BACK I WAS GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN. I DONT KNOW IF SHE WORE A GRAY SUIT, BUT IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR, AS SOON AS I THOUGHT OF HER, THAT SHE WAS THE GRAY ONE. I WENT BACK TO MY FRIEND DEUTSCH, AND I TOLD HIM HE MUST BE RIGHTTHERE IS SOMETHING TO ANALYZING DREAMS. BUT WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT MY INTERESTING DREAM, HE SAID, NO, THAT ONE WAS TOO PERFECTTOO CUT AND DRIED. USUALLY YOU HAVE TO DO A BIT MORE ANALYSIS.TEXTFILE.TXTDISPLAYING TEXTFILE.TXT.
