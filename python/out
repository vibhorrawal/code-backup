IT IS THE FIFTHLARGEST SATELLITE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, AND THE LARGEST AMONG PLANETARY SATELLITES RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE PLANET THAT IT ORBITS ITS PRIMARY. THE MOON IS, AFTER JUPITERS SATELLITE IO, THE SECONDDENSEST SATELLITE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AMONG THOSE WHOSE DENSITIES ARE KNOWN.THE MOON IS THOUGHT TO HAVE FORMED ABOUT . BILLION YEARS AGO, NOT LONG AFTER EARTH. THE MOST WIDELY ACCEPTED EXPLANATION IS THAT THE MOON FORMED FROM THE DEBRIS LEFT OVER AFTER A GIANT IMPACT BETWEEN EARTH AND A MARSSIZED BODY CALLED THEIA. NEW RESEARCH OF MOON ROCKS, ALTHOUGH NOT REJECTING THE THEIA HYPOTHESIS, SUGGESTS THAT THE MOON MAY BE OLDER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.THE MOON IS IN SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION WITH EARTH, AND THUS ALWAYS SHOWS THE SAME SIDE TO EARTH, THE NEAR SIDE. THE NEAR SIDE IS MARKED BY DARK VOLCANIC MARIA THAT FILL THE SPACES BETWEEN THE BRIGHT ANCIENT CRUSTAL HIGHLANDS AND THE PROMINENT IMPACT CRATERS. AFTER THE SUN, THE MOON IS THE SECONDBRIGHTEST REGULARLY VISIBLE CELESTIAL OBJECT IN EARTHS SKY. ITS SURFACE IS ACTUALLY DARK, ALTHOUGH COMPARED TO THE NIGHT SKY IT APPEARS VERY BRIGHT, WITH A REFLECTANCE JUST SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF WORN ASPHALT. ITS GRAVITATIONAL INFLUENCE PRODUCES THE OCEAN TIDES, BODY TIDES, AND THE SLIGHT LENGTHENING OF THE DAY.THE MOONS AVERAGE ORBITAL DISTANCE IS , KM , MI, OR . LIGHTSECONDS. THIS IS ABOUT THIRTY TIMES THE DIAMETER OF EARTH. THE MOONS APPARENT SIZE IN THE SKY IS ALMOST THE SAME AS THAT OF THE SUN, SINCE THE STAR IS ABOUT  TIMES THE LUNAR DISTANCE AND DIAMETER. THEREFORE, THE MOON COVERS THE SUN NEARLY PRECISELY DURING A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE. THIS MATCHING OF APPARENT VISUAL SIZE WILL NOT CONTINUE IN THE FAR FUTURE BECAUSE THE MOONS DISTANCE FROM EARTH IS GRADUALLY INCREASING.THE MOON WAS FIRST REACHED IN SEPTEMBER  BY THE SOVIET UNIONS LUNA , AN UNMANNED SPACECRAFT, FOLLOWED BY THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL SOFT LANDING BY LUNA  IN . THE UNITED STATES NASA APOLLO PROGRAM ACHIEVED THE ONLY MANNED LUNAR MISSIONS TO DATE, BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST MANNED ORBITAL MISSION BY APOLLO  IN , AND SIX MANNED LANDINGS BETWEEN  AND , WITH THE FIRST BEING APOLLO  IN JULY . THESE MISSIONS RETURNED LUNAR ROCKS WHICH HAVE BEEN USED TO DEVELOP A GEOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOONS ORIGIN, INTERNAL STRUCTURE, AND THE MOONS LATER HISTORY. SINCE THE  APOLLO  MISSION THE MOON HAS BEEN VISITED ONLY BY UNMANNED SPACECRAFT.BOTH THE MOONS NATURAL PROMINENCE IN THE EARTHLY SKY AND ITS REGULAR CYCLE OF PHASES AS SEEN FROM EARTH HAVE PROVIDED CULTURAL REFERENCES AND INFLUENCES FOR HUMAN SOCIETIES AND CULTURES SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL.

THE NOUN MOON IS DERIVED FROM OLD ENGLISH MNA, WHICH LIKE ALL GERMANIC LANGUAGE COGNATES STEMS FROM PROTOGERMANIC MN, WHICH COMES FROM PROTOINDOEUROPEAN MHNS MOON, MONTH, WHICH COMES FROM THE PROTOINDOEUROPEAN ROOT MEH TO MEASURE, THE MONTH BEING THE ANCIENT UNIT OF TIME MEASURED BY THE MOON. OCCASIONALLY, THE NAME LUNA IS USED. IN LITERATURE, ESPECIALLY SCIENCE FICTION, LUNA IS USED TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM OTHER MOONS, WHILE IN POETRY, THE NAME HAS BEEN USED TO DENOTE PERSONIFICATION OF EARTHS MOON.THE MODERN ENGLISH ADJECTIVE PERTAINING TO THE MOON IS LUNAR, DERIVED FROM THE LATIN WORD FOR THE MOON, LUNA. THE ADJECTIVE SELENIC USUALLY ONLY USED TO REFER TO THE CHEMICAL ELEMENT SELENIUM IS SO RARELY USED TO REFER TO THE MOON THAT THIS MEANING IS NOT RECORDED IN MOST MAJOR DICTIONARIES. IT IS DERIVED FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK WORD FOR THE MOON,  SELN, FROM WHICH IS HOWEVER ALSO DERIVED THE PREFIX SELENO, AS IN SELENOGRAPHY, THE STUDY OF THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE MOON, AS WELL AS THE ELEMENT NAME SELENIUM. BOTH THE GREEK GODDESS SELENE AND THE ROMAN GODDESS DIANA WERE ALTERNATIVELY CALLED CYNTHIA. THE NAMES LUNA, CYNTHIA, AND SELENE ARE REFLECTED IN TERMINOLOGY FOR LUNAR ORBITS IN WORDS SUCH AS APOLUNE, PERICYNTHION, AND SELENOCENTRIC. THE NAME DIANA COMES FROM THE PROTOINDOEUROPEAN DIWYO, HEAVENLY, WHICH COMES FROM THE PIE ROOT DYEU TO SHINE, WHICH IN MANY DERIVATIVES MEANS SKY, HEAVEN, AND GOD AND IS ALSO THE ORIGIN OF LATIN DIES, DAY.THE MOONNEAR SIDE OF THE MOONFAR SIDE OF THE MOONLUNAR NORTH POLELUNAR SOUTH POLEFORMATIONMAIN ARTICLES ORIGIN OF THE MOON, GIANTIMPACT HYPOTHESIS, AND CIRCUMPLANETARY DISKTHE MOON FORMED . BILLION YEARS AGO,F SOME  MILLION YEARS AFTER THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. SEVERAL FORMING MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, INCLUDING THE FISSION OF THE MOON FROM EARTHS CRUST THROUGH CENTRIFUGAL FORCE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE TOO GREAT AN INITIAL SPIN OF EARTH, THE GRAVITATIONAL CAPTURE OF A PREFORMED MOON WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AN UNFEASIBLY EXTENDED ATMOSPHERE OF EARTH TO DISSIPATE THE ENERGY OF THE PASSING MOON, AND THE COFORMATION OF EARTH AND THE MOON TOGETHER IN THE PRIMORDIAL ACCRETION DISK WHICH DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE DEPLETION OF METALS IN THE MOON. THESE HYPOTHESES ALSO CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGH ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF THE EARTHMOON SYSTEM.FILEEVOLUTION OF THE MOON.OGVTHE EVOLUTION OF THE MOON AND A TOUR OF THE MOONTHE PREVAILING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE EARTHMOON SYSTEM FORMED AFTER AN IMPACT OF A MARSSIZED BODY NAMED THEIA WITH THE PROTOEARTH GIANT IMPACT. THE IMPACT BLASTED MATERIAL INTO EARTHS ORBIT AND THEN THE MATERIAL ACCRETED AND FORMED THE MOON.THE MOONS FAR SIDE HAS A CRUST THAT IS  KM  MI THICKER THAN THAT OF THE NEAR SIDE. THIS IS THOUGHT TO BE BECAUSE THE MOON FUSED FROM TWO DIFFERENT BODIES.THIS HYPOTHESIS, ALTHOUGH NOT PERFECT, PERHAPS BEST EXPLAINS THE EVIDENCE. EIGHTEEN MONTHS PRIOR TO AN OCTOBER  CONFERENCE ON LUNAR ORIGINS, BILL HARTMANN, ROGER PHILLIPS, AND JEFF TAYLOR CHALLENGED FELLOW LUNAR SCIENTISTS YOU HAVE EIGHTEEN MONTHS. GO BACK TO YOUR APOLLO DATA, GO BACK TO YOUR COMPUTER, DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO, BUT MAKE UP YOUR MIND. DONT COME TO OUR CONFERENCE UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE MOONS BIRTH. AT THE  CONFERENCE AT KONA, HAWAII, THE GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS EMERGED AS THE MOST CONSENSUAL THEORY.BEFORE THE CONFERENCE, THERE WERE PARTISANS OF THE THREE TRADITIONAL THEORIES, PLUS A FEW PEOPLE WHO WERE STARTING TO TAKE THE GIANT IMPACT SERIOUSLY, AND THERE WAS A HUGE APATHETIC MIDDLE WHO DIDNT THINK THE DEBATE WOULD EVER BE RESOLVED. AFTERWARD, THERE WERE ESSENTIALLY ONLY TWO GROUPS THE GIANT IMPACT CAMP AND THE AGNOSTICS.GIANT IMPACTS ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN COMMON IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF GIANT IMPACTS HAVE PRODUCED RESULTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MASS OF THE LUNAR CORE AND THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF THE EARTHMOON SYSTEM. THESE SIMULATIONS ALSO SHOW THAT MOST OF THE MOON DERIVED FROM THE IMPACTOR, RATHER THAN THE PROTOEARTH. HOWEVER, MORE RECENT SIMULATIONS SUGGEST A LARGER FRACTION OF THE MOON DERIVED FROM THE PROTOEARTH. OTHER BODIES OF THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM SUCH AS MARS AND VESTA HAVE, ACCORDING TO METEORITES FROM THEM, VERY DIFFERENT OXYGEN AND TUNGSTEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS COMPARED TO EARTH. HOWEVER, EARTH AND THE MOON HAVE NEARLY IDENTICAL ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS. THE ISOTOPIC EQUALIZATION OF THE EARTHMOON SYSTEM MIGHT BE EXPLAINED BY THE POSTIMPACT MIXING OF THE VAPORIZED MATERIAL THAT FORMED THE TWO, ALTHOUGH THIS IS DEBATED.THE IMPACT RELEASED A LOT OF ENERGY AND THEN THE RELEASED MATERIAL REACCRETED INTO THE EARTHMOON SYSTEM. THIS WOULD HAVE MELTED THE OUTER SHELL OF EARTH, AND THUS FORMED A MAGMA OCEAN. SIMILARLY, THE NEWLY FORMED MOON WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND HAD ITS OWN LUNAR MAGMA OCEAN ITS DEPTH IS ESTIMATED FROM ABOUT  KM  MILES TO , KM , MILES.WHILE THE GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS MIGHT EXPLAIN MANY LINES OF EVIDENCE, SOME QUESTIONS ARE STILL UNRESOLVED, MOST OF WHICH INVOLVE THE MOONS COMPOSITION.OCEANUS PROCELLARUM OCEAN OF STORMSANCIENT RIFT VALLEYS  RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE VISIBLE  TOPOGRAPHY  GRAIL GRAVITY GRADIENTSANCIENT RIFT VALLEYS  CONTEXT.ANCIENT RIFT VALLEYS  CLOSEUP ARTISTS CONCEPT.IN , A TEAM AT THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF WASHINGTON REPORTED THE MOST PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF THE ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES OF LUNAR ROCKS. TO THEIR SURPRISE, THE ROCKS FROM THE APOLLO PROGRAM HAD THE SAME ISOTOPIC SIGNATURE AS ROCKS FROM EARTH, HOWEVER THEY DIFFERED FROM ALMOST ALL OTHER BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. INDEED, THIS OBSERVATION WAS UNEXPECTED, BECAUSE MOST OF THE MATERIAL THAT FORMED THE MOON WAS THOUGHT TO COME FROM THEIA AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN  THAT THERE WAS LESS THAN A  CHANCE THAT THEIA AND EARTH HAD IDENTICAL ISOTOPIC SIGNATURES. OTHER APOLLO LUNAR SAMPLES HAD IN  THE SAME TITANIUM ISOTOPES COMPOSITION AS EARTH, WHICH CONFLICTS WITH WHAT IS EXPECTED IF THE MOON FORMED FAR FROM EARTH OR IS DERIVED FROM THEIA. THESE DISCREPANCIES MAY BE EXPLAINED BY VARIATIONS OF THE GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS.PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICSINTERNAL STRUCTUREMAIN ARTICLE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE MOONLUNAR SURFACE CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONCOMPOUNDFORMULACOMPOSITIONMARIAHIGHLANDSSILICASIO..ALUMINAALO..LIMECAO..IRONII OXIDEFEO..MAGNESIAMGO..TITANIUM DIOXIDETIO..SODIUM OXIDENAO.. ..THE MOON IS A DIFFERENTIATED BODY. IT HAS A GEOCHEMICALLY DISTINCT CRUST, MANTLE, AND CORE. THE MOON HAS A SOLID IRONRICH INNER CORE WITH A RADIUS POSSIBLY AS SMALL AS  KILOMETRES  MI AND A FLUID OUTER CORE PRIMARILY MADE OF LIQUID IRON WITH A RADIUS OF ROUGHLY  KILOMETRES  MI. AROUND THE CORE IS A PARTIALLY MOLTEN BOUNDARY LAYER WITH A RADIUS OF ABOUT  KILOMETRES  MI. THIS STRUCTURE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE DEVELOPED THROUGH THE FRACTIONAL CRYSTALLIZATION OF A GLOBAL MAGMA OCEAN SHORTLY AFTER THE MOONS FORMATION . BILLION YEARS AGO.CRYSTALLIZATION OF THIS MAGMA OCEAN WOULD HAVE CREATED A MAFIC MANTLE FROM THE PRECIPITATION AND SINKING OF THE MINERALS OLIVINE, CLINOPYROXENE, AND ORTHOPYROXENE AFTER ABOUT THREEQUARTERS OF THE MAGMA OCEAN HAD CRYSTALLISED, LOWERDENSITY PLAGIOCLASE MINERALS COULD FORM AND FLOAT INTO A CRUST ATOP. THE FINAL LIQUIDS TO CRYSTALLISE WOULD HAVE BEEN INITIALLY SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE CRUST AND MANTLE, WITH A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF INCOMPATIBLE AND HEATPRODUCING ELEMENTS.CONSISTENT WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE, GEOCHEMICAL MAPPING MADE FROM ORBIT SUGGESTS THE CRUST OF MOSTLY ANORTHOSITE. THE MOON ROCK SAMPLES OF THE FLOOD LAVAS THAT ERUPTED ONTO THE SURFACE FROM PARTIAL MELTING IN THE MANTLE CONFIRM THE MAFIC MANTLE COMPOSITION, WHICH IS MORE IRONRICH THAN THAT OF EARTH. THE CRUST IS ON AVERAGE ABOUT  KILOMETRES  MI THICK.THE MOON IS THE SECONDDENSEST SATELLITE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, AFTER IO. HOWEVER, THE INNER CORE OF THE MOON IS SMALL, WITH A RADIUS OF ABOUT  KILOMETRES  MI OR LESS, AROUND  OF THE RADIUS OF THE MOON. ITS COMPOSITION IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, BUT IS PROBABLY METALLIC IRON ALLOYED WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF SULPHUR AND NICKEL ANALYZES OF THE MOONS TIMEVARIABLE ROTATION SUGGEST THAT IT IS AT LEAST PARTLY MOLTEN.SURFACE GEOLOGYMAIN ARTICLES GEOLOGY OF THE MOON, MOON ROCKS, AND LIST OF LUNAR FEATURESTOPOGRAPHY OF THE MOON MEASURED FROM THE LUNAR ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER ON THE MISSION LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER, REFERENCED TO A SPHERE OF RADIUS . KMTOPOGRAPHY OF THE MOONSTL D MODEL OF THE MOON WITH  ELEVATION EXAGGERATION RENDERED WITH DATA FROM THE LUNAR ORBITER LASER ALTIMETER OF THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITERTHE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE MOON HAS BEEN MEASURED WITH LASER ALTIMETRY AND STEREO IMAGE ANALYSIS. ITS MOST VISIBLE TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURE IS THE GIANT FARSIDE SOUTH POLEAITKEN BASIN, SOME , KM , MI IN DIAMETER, THE LARGEST CRATER ON THE MOON AND THE SECONDLARGEST CONFIRMED IMPACT CRATER IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. AT  KM . MI DEEP, ITS FLOOR IS THE LOWEST POINT ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF THE SURFACE ARE LOCATED DIRECTLY TO THE NORTHEAST, AND IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED MIGHT HAVE BEEN THICKENED BY THE OBLIQUE FORMATION IMPACT OF THE SOUTH POLEAITKEN BASIN. OTHER LARGE IMPACT BASINS SUCH AS IMBRIUM, SERENITATIS, CRISIUM, SMYTHII, AND ORIENTALE ALSO POSSESS REGIONALLY LOW ELEVATIONS AND ELEVATED RIMS. THE FAR SIDE OF THE LUNAR SURFACE IS ON AVERAGE ABOUT . KM . MI HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE NEAR SIDE.THE DISCOVERY OF FAULT SCARP CLIFFS BY THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER SUGGEST THAT THE MOON HAS SHRUNK WITHIN THE PAST BILLION YEARS, BY ABOUT  METRES  FT. SIMILAR SHRINKAGE FEATURES EXIST ON MERCURY. A RECENT STUDY OF OVER  IMAGES FROM THE ORBITER HAS OBSERVED THAT MARE FRIGORIS NEAR THE NORTH POLE, A VAST BASIN ASSUMED TO BE GEOLOGICALLY DEAD, HAS BEEN CRACKING AND SHIFTING. SINCE THE MOON DOESNT HAVE TECTONIC PLATES, ITS TECTONIC ACTIVITY IS SLOW AND CRACKS DEVELOP AS IT LOSES HEAT OVER THE YEARS.VOLCANIC FEATURESMAIN ARTICLE LUNAR MARELUNAR NEARSIDE WITH MAJOR MARIA AND CRATERS LABELEDLUNAR NEARSIDE WITH MAJOR MARIA AND CRATERS LABELEDTHE DARK AND RELATIVELY FEATURELESS LUNAR PLAINS, CLEARLY SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE, ARE CALLED MARIA LATIN FOR SEAS SINGULAR MARE, AS THEY WERE ONCE BELIEVED TO BE FILLED WITH WATER THEY ARE NOW KNOWN TO BE VAST SOLIDIFIED POOLS OF ANCIENT BASALTIC LAVA. ALTHOUGH SIMILAR TO TERRESTRIAL BASALTS, LUNAR BASALTS HAVE MORE IRON AND NO MINERALS ALTERED BY WATER. THE MAJORITY OF THESE LAVAS ERUPTED OR FLOWED INTO THE DEPRESSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPACT BASINS. SEVERAL GEOLOGIC PROVINCES CONTAINING SHIELD VOLCANOES AND VOLCANIC DOMES ARE FOUND WITHIN THE NEAR SIDE MARIA.EVIDENCE OF YOUNG LUNAR VOLCANISMALMOST ALL MARIA ARE ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE MOON, AND COVER  OF THE SURFACE OF THE NEAR SIDE, COMPARED WITH  OF THE FAR SIDE. THIS IS THOUGHT TO BE DUE TO A CONCENTRATION OF HEATPRODUCING ELEMENTS UNDER THE CRUST ON THE NEAR SIDE, SEEN ON GEOCHEMICAL MAPS OBTAINED BY LUNAR PROSPECTORS GAMMARAY SPECTROMETER, WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE UNDERLYING MANTLE TO HEAT UP, PARTIALLY MELT, RISE TO THE SURFACE AND ERUPT. MOST OF THE MOONS MARE BASALTS ERUPTED DURING THE IMBRIAN PERIOD, .. BILLION YEARS AGO, ALTHOUGH SOME RADIOMETRICALLY DATED SAMPLES ARE AS OLD AS . BILLION YEARS. UNTIL RECENTLY, THE YOUNGEST ERUPTIONS, DATED BY CRATER COUNTING, APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN ONLY . BILLION YEARS AGO. IN , A STUDY OF INA, A TINY DEPRESSION IN LACUS FELICITATIS, FOUND JAGGED, RELATIVELY DUSTFREE FEATURES THAT, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EROSION BY INFALLING DEBRIS, APPEARED TO BE ONLY  MILLION YEARS OLD. MOONQUAKES AND RELEASES OF GAS ALSO INDICATE SOME CONTINUED LUNAR ACTIVITY. IN  NASA ANNOUNCED WIDESPREAD EVIDENCE OF YOUNG LUNAR VOLCANISM AT  IRREGULAR MARE PATCHES IDENTIFIED BY THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER, SOME LESS THAN  MILLION YEARS OLD. THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF A MUCH WARMER LUNAR MANTLE THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED, AT LEAST ON THE NEAR SIDE WHERE THE DEEP CRUST IS SUBSTANTIALLY WARMER BECAUSE OF THE GREATER CONCENTRATION OF RADIOACTIVE ELEMENTS. JUST PRIOR TO THIS, EVIDENCE HAS BEEN PRESENTED FOR  MILLION YEARS YOUNGER BASALTIC VOLCANISM INSIDE LOWELL CRATER, ORIENTALE BASIN, LOCATED IN THE TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN THE NEAR AND FAR SIDES OF THE MOON. AN INITIALLY HOTTER MANTLE ANDOR LOCAL ENRICHMENT OF HEATPRODUCING ELEMENTS IN THE MANTLE COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROLONGED ACTIVITIES ALSO ON THE FAR SIDE IN THE ORIENTALE BASIN.THE LIGHTERCOLORED REGIONS OF THE MOON ARE CALLED TERRAE, OR MORE COMMONLY HIGHLANDS, BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHER THAN MOST MARIA. THEY HAVE BEEN RADIOMETRICALLY DATED TO HAVING FORMED . BILLION YEARS AGO, AND MAY REPRESENT PLAGIOCLASE CUMULATES OF THE LUNAR MAGMA OCEAN. IN CONTRAST TO EARTH, NO MAJOR LUNAR MOUNTAINS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE FORMED AS A RESULT OF TECTONIC EVENTS.THE CONCENTRATION OF MARIA ON THE NEAR SIDE LIKELY REFLECTS THE SUBSTANTIALLY THICKER CRUST OF THE HIGHLANDS OF THE FAR SIDE, WHICH MAY HAVE FORMED IN A SLOWVELOCITY IMPACT OF A SECOND MOON OF EARTH A FEW TENS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS AFTER THEIR FORMATION.IMPACT CRATERSFURTHER INFORMATION LIST OF CRATERS ON THE MOONA GRAY, MANYRIDGED SURFACE FROM HIGH ABOVE. THE LARGEST FEATURE IS A CIRCULAR RINGED STRUCTURE WITH HIGH WALLED SIDES AND A LOWER CENTRAL PEAK THE ENTIRE SURFACE OUT TO THE HORIZON IS FILLED WITH SIMILAR STRUCTURES THAT ARE SMALLER AND OVERLAPPING.LUNAR CRATER DAEDALUS ON THE MOONS FAR SIDETHE OTHER MAJOR GEOLOGIC PROCESS THAT HAS AFFECTED THE MOONS SURFACE IS IMPACT CRATERING, WITH CRATERS FORMED WHEN ASTEROIDS AND COMETS COLLIDE WITH THE LUNAR SURFACE. THERE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ROUGHLY , CRATERS WIDER THAN  KM . MI ON THE MOONS NEAR SIDE ALONE. THE LUNAR GEOLOGIC TIMESCALE IS BASED ON THE MOST PROMINENT IMPACT EVENTS, INCLUDING NECTARIS, IMBRIUM, AND ORIENTALE, STRUCTURES CHARACTERIZED BY MULTIPLE RINGS OF UPLIFTED MATERIAL, BETWEEN HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS IN DIAMETER AND ASSOCIATED WITH A BROAD APRON OF EJECTA DEPOSITS THAT FORM A REGIONAL STRATIGRAPHIC HORIZON. THE LACK OF AN ATMOSPHERE, WEATHER AND RECENT GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES MEAN THAT MANY OF THESE CRATERS ARE WELLPRESERVED. ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW MULTIRING BASINS HAVE BEEN DEFINITIVELY DATED, THEY ARE USEFUL FOR ASSIGNING RELATIVE AGES. BECAUSE IMPACT CRATERS ACCUMULATE AT A NEARLY CONSTANT RATE, COUNTING THE NUMBER OF CRATERS PER UNIT AREA CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE AGE OF THE SURFACE. THE RADIOMETRIC AGES OF IMPACTMELTED ROCKS COLLECTED DURING THE APOLLO MISSIONS CLUSTER BETWEEN . AND . BILLION YEARS OLD THIS HAS BEEN USED TO PROPOSE A LATE HEAVY BOMBARDMENT OF IMPACTS.BLANKETED ON TOP OF THE MOONS CRUST IS A HIGHLY COMMINUTED BROKEN INTO EVER SMALLER PARTICLES AND IMPACT GARDENED SURFACE LAYER CALLED REGOLITH, FORMED BY IMPACT PROCESSES. THE FINER REGOLITH, THE LUNAR SOIL OF SILICON DIOXIDE GLASS, HAS A TEXTURE RESEMBLING SNOW AND A SCENT RESEMBLING SPENT GUNPOWDER. THE REGOLITH OF OLDER SURFACES IS GENERALLY THICKER THAN FOR YOUNGER SURFACES IT VARIES IN THICKNESS FROM  KM .. MI IN THE HIGHLANDS AND  KM .. MI IN THE MARIA. BENEATH THE FINELY COMMINUTED REGOLITH LAYER IS THE MEGAREGOLITH, A LAYER OF HIGHLY FRACTURED BEDROCK MANY KILOMETERS THICK.COMPARISON OF HIGHRESOLUTION IMAGES OBTAINED BY THE LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER HAS SHOWN A CONTEMPORARY CRATERPRODUCTION RATE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED. A SECONDARY CRATERING PROCESS CAUSED BY DISTAL EJECTA IS THOUGHT TO CHURN THE TOP TWO CENTIMETERS OF REGOLITH A HUNDRED TIMES MORE QUICKLY THAN PREVIOUS MODELS SUGGESTED  ON A TIMESCALE OF , YEARS.LUNAR SWIRLS AT REINER GAMMALUNAR SWIRLSMAIN ARTICLE LUNAR SWIRLSLUNAR SWIRLS ARE ENIGMATIC FEATURES FOUND ACROSS THE MOONS SURFACE. THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH ALBEDO, APPEAR OPTICALLY IMMATURE I.E. THE OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A RELATIVELY YOUNG REGOLITH, AND HAVE OFTEN A SINUOUS SHAPE. THEIR SHAPE IS OFTEN ACCENTUATED BY LOW ALBEDO REGIONS THAT WIND BETWEEN THE BRIGHT SWIRLS.PRESENCE OF WATERMAIN ARTICLE LUNAR WATERLIQUID WATER CANNOT PERSIST ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. WHEN EXPOSED TO SOLAR RADIATION, WATER QUICKLY DECOMPOSES THROUGH A PROCESS KNOWN AS PHOTODISSOCIATION AND IS LOST TO SPACE. HOWEVER, SINCE THE S, SCIENTISTS HAVE HYPOTHESIZED THAT WATER ICE MAY BE DEPOSITED BY IMPACTING COMETS OR POSSIBLY PRODUCED BY THE REACTION OF OXYGENRICH LUNAR ROCKS, AND HYDROGEN FROM SOLAR WIND, LEAVING TRACES OF WATER WHICH COULD POSSIBLY PERSIST IN COLD, PERMANENTLY SHADOWED CRATERS AT EITHER POLE ON THE MOON. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS SUGGEST THAT UP TO , KM , SQ MI OF THE SURFACE MAY BE IN PERMANENT SHADOW. THE PRESENCE OF USABLE QUANTITIES OF WATER ON THE MOON IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN RENDERING LUNAR HABITATION AS A COSTEFFECTIVE PLAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF TRANSPORTING WATER FROM EARTH WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE.IN YEARS SINCE, SIGNATURES OF WATER HAVE BEEN FOUND TO EXIST ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. IN , THE BISTATIC RADAR EXPERIMENT LOCATED ON THE CLEMENTINE SPACECRAFT, INDICATED THE EXISTENCE OF SMALL, FROZEN POCKETS OF WATER CLOSE TO THE SURFACE. HOWEVER, LATER RADAR OBSERVATIONS BY ARECIBO, SUGGEST THESE FINDINGS MAY RATHER BE ROCKS EJECTED FROM YOUNG IMPACT CRATERS. IN , THE NEUTRON SPECTROMETER ON THE LUNAR PROSPECTOR SPACECRAFT SHOWED THAT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF HYDROGEN ARE PRESENT IN THE FIRST METER OF DEPTH IN THE REGOLITH NEAR THE POLAR REGIONS. VOLCANIC LAVA BEADS, BROUGHT BACK TO EARTH ABOARD APOLLO , SHOWED SMALL AMOUNTS OF WATER IN THEIR INTERIOR.THE  CHANDRAYAAN SPACECRAFT HAS SINCE CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF SURFACE WATER ICE, USING THE ONBOARD MOON MINERALOGY MAPPER. THE SPECTROMETER OBSERVED ABSORPTION LINES COMMON TO HYDROXYL, IN REFLECTED SUNLIGHT, PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF WATER ICE, ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. THE SPACECRAFT SHOWED THAT CONCENTRATIONS MAY POSSIBLY BE AS HIGH AS , PPM. USING THE MAPPERS REFLECTANCE SPECTRA, INDIRECT LIGHTING OF AREAS IN SHADOW CONFIRMED WATER ICE WITHIN  LATITUDE OF BOTH POLES IN . IN , LCROSS SENT A , KG , LB IMPACTOR INTO A PERMANENTLY SHADOWED POLAR CRATER, AND DETECTED AT LEAST  KG  LB OF WATER IN A PLUME OF EJECTED MATERIAL. ANOTHER EXAMINATION OF THE LCROSS DATA SHOWED THE AMOUNT OF DETECTED WATER TO BE CLOSER TO    KG    LB.IN MAY ,  PPM WATER IN MELT INCLUSIONS IN LUNAR SAMPLE  WAS REPORTED, THE FAMOUS HIGHTITANIUM ORANGE GLASS SOIL OF VOLCANIC ORIGIN COLLECTED DURING THE APOLLO  MISSION IN . THE INCLUSIONS WERE FORMED DURING EXPLOSIVE ERUPTIONS ON THE MOON APPROXIMATELY . BILLION YEARS AGO. THIS CONCENTRATION IS COMPARABLE WITH THAT OF MAGMA IN EARTHS UPPER MANTLE. ALTHOUGH OF CONSIDERABLE SELENOLOGICAL INTEREST, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AFFORDS LITTLE COMFORT TO WOULDBE LUNAR COLONISTS  THE SAMPLE ORIGINATED MANY KILOMETERS BELOW THE SURFACE, AND THE INCLUSIONS ARE SO DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THAT IT TOOK  YEARS TO FIND THEM WITH A STATEOFTHEART ION MICROPROBE INSTRUMENT.ANALYSIS OF THE FINDINGS OF THE MOON MINERALOGY MAPPER M REVEALED IN AUGUST  FOR THE FIRST TIME DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE FOR WATERICE ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. THE DATA REVEALED THE DISTINCT REFLECTIVE SIGNATURES OF WATERICE, AS OPPOSED TO DUST AND OTHER REFLECTIVE SUBSTANCES. THE ICE DEPOSITS WERE FOUND ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH POLES, ALTHOUGH IT IS MORE ABUNDANT IN THE SOUTH, WHERE WATER IS TRAPPED IN PERMANENTLY SHADOWED CRATERS AND CRAVICES, ALLOWING IT TO PERSIST AS ICE ON THE SURFACE SINCE THEY ARE SHIELDED FROM THE SUN.GRAVITATIONAL FIELDMAIN ARTICLE GRAVITY OF THE MOONGRAILS GRAVITY MAP OF THE MOONTHE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD OF THE MOON HAS BEEN MEASURED THROUGH TRACKING THE DOPPLER SHIFT OF RADIO SIGNALS EMITTED BY ORBITING SPACECRAFT. THE MAIN LUNAR GRAVITY FEATURES ARE MASCONS, LARGE POSITIVE GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE GIANT IMPACT BASINS, PARTLY CAUSED BY THE DENSE MARE BASALTIC LAVA FLOWS THAT FILL THOSE BASINS. THE ANOMALIES GREATLY INFLUENCE THE ORBIT OF SPACECRAFT ABOUT THE MOON. THERE ARE SOME PUZZLES LAVA FLOWS BY THEMSELVES CANNOT EXPLAIN ALL OF THE GRAVITATIONAL SIGNATURE, AND SOME MASCONS EXIST THAT ARE NOT LINKED TO MARE VOLCANISM.MAGNETIC FIELDMAIN ARTICLE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE MOONTHE MOON HAS AN EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD OF ABOUT  NANOTESLAS, LESS THAN ONEHUNDREDTH THAT OF EARTH. THE MOON DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A GLOBAL DIPOLAR MAGNETIC FIELD AND ONLY HAS CRUSTAL MAGNETIZATION LIKELY ACQUIRED EARLY IN ITS HISTORY WHEN A DYNAMO WAS STILL OPERATING. THEORETICALLY, SOME OF THE REMNANT MAGNETIZATION MAY ORIGINATE FROM TRANSIENT MAGNETIC FIELDS GENERATED DURING LARGE IMPACTS THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF PLASMA CLOUDS. THESE CLOUDS ARE GENERATED DURING LARGE IMPACTS IN AN AMBIENT MAGNETIC FIELD. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE LOCATION OF THE LARGEST CRUSTAL MAGNETIZATIONS SITUATED NEAR THE ANTIPODES OF THE GIANT IMPACT BASINS.ATMOSPHEREMAIN ARTICLE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MOONSKETCH BY THE APOLLO  ASTRONAUTS. THE LUNAR ATMOSPHERE WAS LATER STUDIED BY LADEE.THE MOON HAS AN ATMOSPHERE SO TENUOUS AS TO BE NEARLY VACUUM, WITH A TOTAL MASS OF LESS THAN  METRIC TONS . LONG TONS  SHORT TONS. THE SURFACE PRESSURE OF THIS SMALL MASS IS AROUND    ATM . NPA IT VARIES WITH THE LUNAR DAY. ITS SOURCES INCLUDE OUTGASSING AND SPUTTERING, A PRODUCT OF THE BOMBARDMENT OF LUNAR SOIL BY SOLAR WIND IONS. ELEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DETECTED INCLUDE SODIUM AND POTASSIUM, PRODUCED BY SPUTTERING ALSO FOUND IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF MERCURY AND IO HELIUM AND NEON FROM THE SOLAR WIND AND ARGON, RADON, AND POLONIUM, OUTGASSED AFTER THEIR CREATION BY RADIOACTIVE DECAY WITHIN THE CRUST AND MANTLE. THE ABSENCE OF SUCH NEUTRAL SPECIES ATOMS OR MOLECULES AS OXYGEN, NITROGEN, CARBON, HYDROGEN AND MAGNESIUM, WHICH ARE PRESENT IN THE REGOLITH, IS NOT UNDERSTOOD. WATER VAPOR HAS BEEN DETECTED BY CHANDRAYAAN AND FOUND TO VARY WITH LATITUDE, WITH A MAXIMUM AT  DEGREES IT IS POSSIBLY GENERATED FROM THE SUBLIMATION OF WATER ICE IN THE REGOLITH. THESE GASES EITHER RETURN INTO THE REGOLITH BECAUSE OF THE MOONS GRAVITY OR ARE LOST TO SPACE, EITHER THROUGH SOLAR RADIATION PRESSURE OR, IF THEY ARE IONIZED, BY BEING SWEPT AWAY BY THE SOLAR WINDS MAGNETIC FIELD.DUSTA PERMANENT ASYMMETRIC MOON DUST CLOUD EXISTS AROUND THE MOON, CREATED BY SMALL PARTICLES FROM COMETS. ESTIMATES ARE  TONS OF COMET PARTICLES STRIKE THE MOONS SURFACE EVERY  HOURS. THE PARTICLES STRIKING THE MOONS SURFACE EJECT MOON DUST ABOVE THE MOON. THE DUST STAYS ABOVE THE MOON APPROXIMATELY  MINUTES, TAKING  MINUTES TO RISE, AND  MINUTES TO FALL. ON AVERAGE,  KILOGRAMS OF DUST ARE PRESENT ABOVE THE MOON, RISING TO  KILOMETERS ABOVE THE SURFACE. THE DUST MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE BY LADEES LUNAR DUST EXPERIMENT LDEX, BETWEEN  AND  KILOMETERS ABOVE THE SURFACE, DURING A SIXMONTH PERIOD. LDEX DETECTED AN AVERAGE OF ONE . MICROMETER MOON DUST PARTICLE EACH MINUTE. DUST PARTICLE COUNTS PEAKED DURING THE GEMINID, QUADRANTID, NORTHERN TAURID, AND OMICRON CENTAURID METEOR SHOWERS, WHEN THE EARTH, AND MOON, PASS THROUGH COMET DEBRIS. THE CLOUD IS ASYMMETRIC, MORE DENSE NEAR THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE MOONS DAYSIDE AND NIGHTSIDE.PAST THICKER ATMOSPHEREIN OCTOBER , NASA SCIENTISTS AT THE MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER AND THE LUNAR AND PLANETARY INSTITUTE IN HOUSTON ANNOUNCED THEIR FINDING, BASED ON STUDIES OF MOON MAGMA SAMPLES RETRIEVED BY THE APOLLO MISSIONS, THAT THE MOON HAD ONCE POSSESSED A RELATIVELY THICK ATMOSPHERE FOR A PERIOD OF  MILLION YEARS BETWEEN  AND  BILLION YEARS AGO. THIS ATMOSPHERE, SOURCED FROM GASES EJECTED FROM LUNAR VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS, WAS TWICE THE THICKNESS OF THAT OF PRESENTDAY MARS. THE ANCIENT LUNAR ATMOSPHERE WAS EVENTUALLY STRIPPED AWAY BY SOLAR WINDS AND DISSIPATED INTO SPACE.SEASONSTHE MOONS AXIAL TILT WITH RESPECT TO THE ECLIPTIC IS ONLY ., MUCH LESS THAN THE . OF EARTH. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE MOONS SOLAR ILLUMINATION VARIES MUCH LESS WITH SEASON, AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN SEASONAL EFFECTS. FROM IMAGES TAKEN BY CLEMENTINE IN , IT APPEARS THAT FOUR MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS ON THE RIM OF PEARY CRATER AT THE MOONS NORTH POLE MAY REMAIN ILLUMINATED FOR THE ENTIRE LUNAR DAY, CREATING PEAKS OF ETERNAL LIGHT. NO SUCH REGIONS EXIST AT THE SOUTH POLE. SIMILARLY, THERE ARE PLACES THAT REMAIN IN PERMANENT SHADOW AT THE BOTTOMS OF MANY POLAR CRATERS, AND THESE CRATERS OF ETERNAL DARKNESS ARE EXTREMELY COLD LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER MEASURED THE LOWEST SUMMER TEMPERATURES IN CRATERS AT THE SOUTHERN POLE AT  K  C  F AND JUST  K  C  F CLOSE TO THE WINTER SOLSTICE IN NORTH POLAR HERMITE CRATER. THIS IS THE COLDEST TEMPERATURE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM EVER MEASURED BY A SPACECRAFT, COLDER EVEN THAN THE SURFACE OF PLUTO.

DAYSH ITS SYNODIC PERIOD. UNLIKE MOST SATELLITES OF OTHER PLANETS, THE MOON ORBITS CLOSER TO THE ECLIPTIC PLANE THAN TO THE PLANETS EQUATORIAL PLANE. THE MOONS ORBIT IS SUBTLY PERTURBED BY THE SUN AND EARTH IN MANY SMALL, COMPLEX AND INTERACTING WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PLANE OF THE MOONS ORBIT GRADUALLY ROTATES ONCE EVERY . YEARS, WHICH AFFECTS OTHER ASPECTS OF LUNAR MOTION. THESE FOLLOWON EFFECTS ARE MATHEMATICALLY DESCRIBED BY CASSINIS LAWS.RELATIVE SIZETHE MOON IS EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE RELATIVE TO EARTH ITS DIAMETER IS MORE THAN A QUARTER AND ITS MASS IS  OF EARTHS.

THIS RESULTS IN IT ALWAYS KEEPING NEARLY THE SAME FACE TURNED TOWARDS EARTH. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT OF LIBRATION, ABOUT  OF THE MOONS SURFACE CAN ACTUALLY BE SEEN FROM EARTH. THE SIDE OF THE MOON THAT FACES EARTH IS CALLED THE NEAR SIDE, AND THE OPPOSITE THE FAR SIDE. THE FAR SIDE IS OFTEN INACCURATELY CALLED THE DARK SIDE, BUT IT IS IN FACT ILLUMINATED AS OFTEN AS THE NEAR SIDE ONCE EVERY . EARTH DAYS. DURING NEW MOON, THE NEAR SIDE IS DARK.THE MOON HAD ONCE ROTATED AT A FASTER RATE, BUT EARLY IN ITS HISTORY, ITS ROTATION SLOWED AND BECAME TIDALLY LOCKED IN THIS ORIENTATION AS A RESULT OF FRICTIONAL EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH TIDAL DEFORMATIONS CAUSED BY EARTH. WITH TIME, THE ENERGY OF ROTATION OF THE MOON ON ITS AXIS WAS DISSIPATED AS HEAT, UNTIL THERE WAS NO ROTATION OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO EARTH. IN , PLANETARY SCIENTISTS, USING DATA COLLECTED ON THE MUCH EARLIER NASA LUNAR PROSPECTOR MISSION, FOUND TWO HYDROGENRICH AREAS ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE MOON, PROBABLY IN THE FORM OF WATER ICE. IT IS SPECULATED THAT THESE PATCHES WERE THE POLES OF THE MOON BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO, BEFORE IT WAS TIDALLY LOCKED TO EARTH.THE MOON IS PROMINENTLY FEATURED IN VINCENT VAN GOGHS  PAINTING, THE STARRY NIGHTTHE MOON HAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY LOW ALBEDO, GIVING IT A REFLECTANCE THAT IS SLIGHTLY BRIGHTER THAN THAT OF WORN ASPHALT. DESPITE THIS, IT IS THE BRIGHTEST OBJECT IN THE SKY AFTER THE SUN.K THIS IS DUE PARTLY TO THE BRIGHTNESS ENHANCEMENT OF THE OPPOSITION SURGE THE MOON AT QUARTER PHASE IS ONLY ONETENTH AS BRIGHT, RATHER THAN HALF AS BRIGHT, AS AT FULL MOON. ADDITIONALLY, COLOR CONSTANCY IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM RECALIBRATES THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COLORS OF AN OBJECT AND ITS SURROUNDINGS, AND BECAUSE THE SURROUNDING SKY IS COMPARATIVELY DARK, THE SUNLIT MOON IS PERCEIVED AS A BRIGHT OBJECT. THE EDGES OF THE FULL MOON SEEM AS BRIGHT AS THE CENTER, WITHOUT LIMB DARKENING, BECAUSE OF THE REFLECTIVE PROPERTIES OF LUNAR SOIL, WHICH RETROREFLECTS LIGHT MORE TOWARDS THE SUN THAN IN OTHER DIRECTIONS. THE MOON DOES APPEAR LARGER WHEN CLOSE TO THE HORIZON, BUT THIS IS A PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT, KNOWN AS THE MOON ILLUSION, FIRST DESCRIBED IN THE TH CENTURY BC. THE FULL MOONS ANGULAR DIAMETER IS ABOUT . ON AVERAGE IN THE SKY, ROUGHLY THE SAME APPARENT SIZE AS THE SUN SEE  ECLIPSES.THE MOONS HIGHEST ALTITUDE AT CULMINATION VARIES BY ITS PHASE AND TIME OF YEAR. THE FULL MOON IS HIGHEST IN THE SKY DURING WINTER FOR EACH HEMISPHERE. THE .YEAR NODAL CYCLE HAS AN INFLUENCE ON LUNAR STANDSTILL. WHEN THE ASCENDING NODE OF THE LUNAR ORBIT IS IN THE VERNAL EQUINOX, THE LUNAR DECLINATION CAN REACH UP TO PLUS OR MINUS  EACH MONTH. THIS MEANS THE MOON CAN PASS OVERHEAD IF VIEWED FROM LATITUDES UP TO  NORTH OR SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR, INSTEAD OF ONLY . THE ORIENTATION OF THE MOONS CRESCENT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE LATITUDE OF THE VIEWING LOCATION AN OBSERVER IN THE TROPICS CAN SEE A SMILESHAPED CRESCENT MOON. THE MOON IS VISIBLE FOR TWO WEEKS EVERY .

THIS GIVES A MAXIMUM PERCEIVED INCREASE OF  BETWEEN APOGEE AND PERIGEE MOONS OF THE SAME PHASE.THERE HAS BEEN HISTORICAL CONTROVERSY OVER WHETHER FEATURES ON THE MOONS SURFACE CHANGE OVER TIME. TODAY, MANY OF THESE CLAIMS ARE THOUGHT TO BE ILLUSORY, RESULTING FROM OBSERVATION UNDER DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONS, POOR ASTRONOMICAL SEEING, OR INADEQUATE DRAWINGS. HOWEVER, OUTGASSING DOES OCCASIONALLY OCCUR AND COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A MINOR PERCENTAGE OF THE REPORTED LUNAR TRANSIENT PHENOMENA. RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT A ROUGHLY  KM . MI DIAMETER REGION OF THE LUNAR SURFACE WAS MODIFIED BY A GAS RELEASE EVENT ABOUT A MILLION YEARS AGO.THE MOONS APPEARANCE, LIKE THE SUNS, CAN BE AFFECTED BY EARTHS ATMOSPHERE. COMMON OPTICAL EFFECTS ARE THE  HALO RING, FORMED WHEN THE MOONS LIGHT IS REFRACTED THROUGH THE ICE CRYSTALS OF HIGH CIRROSTRATUS CLOUDS, AND SMALLER CORONAL RINGS WHEN THE MOON IS SEEN THROUGH THIN CLOUDS.THE MONTHLY CHANGES IN THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE DIRECTION OF SUNLIGHT AND VIEW FROM EARTH, AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON THAT RESULT, AS VIEWED FROM THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.

ALSO VISIBLE IS THE SLIGHT VARIATION IN THE MOONS VISUAL SIZE FROM EARTH.THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION THAT MASSES HAVE FOR ONE ANOTHER DECREASES INVERSELY WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE OF THOSE MASSES FROM EACH OTHER. AS A RESULT, THE SLIGHTLY GREATER ATTRACTION THAT THE MOON HAS FOR THE SIDE OF EARTH CLOSEST TO THE MOON, AS COMPARED TO THE PART OF THE EARTH OPPOSITE THE MOON, RESULTS IN TIDAL FORCES. TIDAL FORCES AFFECT BOTH THE EARTHS CRUST AND OCEANS.THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECT OF TIDAL FORCES IS TO CAUSE TWO BULGES IN THE EARTHS OCEANS, ONE ON THE SIDE FACING THE MOON AND THE OTHER ON THE SIDE OPPOSITE. THIS RESULTS IN ELEVATED SEA LEVELS CALLED OCEAN TIDES. AS THE EARTH SPINS ON ITS AXIS, ONE OF THE OCEAN BULGES HIGH TIDE IS HELD IN PLACE UNDER THE MOON, WHILE ANOTHER SUCH TIDE IS OPPOSITE. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE TWO HIGH TIDES, AND TWO LOW TIDES IN ABOUT  HOURS. SINCE THE MOON IS ORBITING THE EARTH IN THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE EARTHS ROTATION, THE HIGH TIDES OCCUR ABOUT EVERY  HOURS AND  MINUTES THE  MINUTES IS DUE TO THE MOONS TIME TO ORBIT THE EARTH. THE SUN HAS THE SAME TIDAL EFFECT ON THE EARTH, BUT ITS FORCES OF ATTRACTION ARE ONLY  THAT OF THE MOONS THE SUNS AND MOONS INTERPLAY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SPRING AND NEAP TIDES. IF THE EARTH WERE A WATER WORLD ONE WITH NO CONTINENTS IT WOULD PRODUCE A TIDE OF ONLY ONE METER, AND THAT TIDE WOULD BE VERY PREDICTABLE, BUT THE OCEAN TIDES ARE GREATLY MODIFIED BY OTHER EFFECTS THE FRICTIONAL COUPLING OF WATER TO EARTHS ROTATION THROUGH THE OCEAN FLOORS, THE INERTIA OF WATERS MOVEMENT, OCEAN BASINS THAT GROW SHALLOWER NEAR LAND, THE SLOSHING OF WATER BETWEEN DIFFERENT OCEAN BASINS. AS A RESULT, THE TIMING OF THE TIDES AT MOST POINTS ON THE EARTH IS A PRODUCT OF OBSERVATIONS THAT ARE EXPLAINED, INCIDENTALLY, BY THEORY.WHILE GRAVITATION CAUSES ACCELERATION AND MOVEMENT OF THE EARTHS FLUID OCEANS, GRAVITATIONAL COUPLING BETWEEN THE MOON AND EARTHS SOLID BODY IS MOSTLY ELASTIC AND PLASTIC. THE RESULT IS A FURTHER TIDAL EFFECT OF THE MOON ON THE EARTH THAT CAUSES A BULGE OF THE SOLID PORTION OF THE EARTH NEAREST THE MOON THAT ACTS AS A TORQUE IN OPPOSITION TO THE EARTHS ROTATION. THIS DRAINS ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND ROTATIONAL KINETIC ENERGY FROM EARTHS SPIN, SLOWING THE EARTHS ROTATION. THAT ANGULAR MOMENTUM, LOST FROM THE EARTH, IS TRANSFERRED TO THE MOON IN A PROCESS CONFUSINGLY KNOWN AS TIDAL ACCELERATION, WHICH LIFTS THE MOON INTO A HIGHER ORBIT AND RESULTS IN ITS LOWER ORBITAL SPEED ABOUT THE EARTH. THUS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EARTH AND MOON IS INCREASING, AND THE EARTHS SPIN IS SLOWING IN REACTION. MEASUREMENTS FROM LASER REFLECTORS LEFT DURING THE APOLLO MISSIONS LUNAR RANGING EXPERIMENTS HAVE FOUND THAT THE MOONS DISTANCE INCREASES BY  MM . IN PER YEAR ROUGHLY THE RATE AT WHICH HUMAN FINGERNAILS GROW. ATOMIC CLOCKS ALSO SHOW THAT EARTHS DAY LENGTHENS BY ABOUT  MICROSECONDS EVERY YEAR, SLOWLY INCREASING THE RATE AT WHICH UTC IS ADJUSTED BY LEAP SECONDS. LEFT TO RUN ITS COURSE, THIS TIDAL DRAG WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL THE SPIN OF EARTH AND THE ORBITAL PERIOD OF THE MOON MATCHED, CREATING MUTUAL TIDAL LOCKING BETWEEN THE TWO. AS A RESULT, THE MOON WOULD BE SUSPENDED IN THE SKY OVER ONE MERIDIAN, AS IS ALREADY CURRENTLY THE CASE WITH PLUTO AND ITS MOON CHARON. HOWEVER, THE SUN WILL BECOME A RED GIANT ENGULFING THE EARTHMOON SYSTEM LONG BEFORE THIS OCCURRENCE.IN A LIKE MANNER, THE LUNAR SURFACE EXPERIENCES TIDES OF AROUND  CM  IN AMPLITUDE OVER  DAYS, WITH TWO COMPONENTS A FIXED ONE DUE TO EARTH, BECAUSE THEY ARE IN SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION, AND A VARYING COMPONENT FROM THE SUN. THE EARTHINDUCED COMPONENT ARISES FROM LIBRATION, A RESULT OF THE MOONS ORBITAL ECCENTRICITY IF THE MOONS ORBIT WERE PERFECTLY CIRCULAR, THERE WOULD ONLY BE SOLAR TIDES. LIBRATION ALSO CHANGES THE ANGLE FROM WHICH THE MOON IS SEEN, ALLOWING A TOTAL OF ABOUT  OF ITS SURFACE TO BE SEEN FROM EARTH OVER TIME. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF STRESS BUILT UP BY THESE TIDAL FORCES PRODUCES MOONQUAKES. MOONQUAKES ARE MUCH LESS COMMON AND WEAKER THAN ARE EARTHQUAKES, ALTHOUGH MOONQUAKES CAN LAST FOR UP TO AN HOUR  SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN TERRESTRIAL QUAKES  BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF WATER TO DAMP OUT THE SEISMIC VIBRATIONS. THE EXISTENCE OF MOONQUAKES WAS AN UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY FROM SEISMOMETERS PLACED ON THE MOON BY APOLLO ASTRONAUTS FROM  THROUGH .ECLIPSESMAIN ARTICLES SOLAR ECLIPSE, LUNAR ECLIPSE, AND ECLIPSE CYCLETHE FIERCELY BRIGHT DISK OF THE SUN IS COMPLETELY OBSCURED BY THE EXACT FIT OF THE DISK OF THE DARK, NONILLUMINATED MOON, LEAVING ONLY THE RADIAL, FUZZY, GLOWING CORONAL FILAMENTS OF THE SUN AROUND THE EDGE.THE BRIGHT DISK OF THE SUN, SHOWING MANY CORONAL FILAMENTS, FLARES AND GRAINY PATCHES IN THE WAVELENGTH OF THIS IMAGE, IS PARTLY OBSCURED BY A SMALL DARK DISK HERE, THE MOON COVERS LESS THAN A FIFTEENTH OF THE SUN.FROM EARTH, THE MOON AND THE SUN APPEAR THE SAME SIZE, AS SEEN IN THE  SOLAR ECLIPSE LEFT, WHEREAS FROM THE STEREOB SPACECRAFT IN AN EARTHTRAILING ORBIT, THE MOON APPEARS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE SUN RIGHT.ECLIPSES ONLY OCCUR WHEN THE SUN, EARTH, AND MOON ARE ALL IN A STRAIGHT LINE TERMED SYZYGY. SOLAR ECLIPSES OCCUR AT NEW MOON, WHEN THE MOON IS BETWEEN THE SUN AND EARTH. IN CONTRAST, LUNAR ECLIPSES OCCUR AT FULL MOON, WHEN EARTH IS BETWEEN THE SUN AND MOON. THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE MOON IS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE SUN, WITH BOTH BEING VIEWED AT CLOSE TO ONEHALF A DEGREE WIDE. THE SUN IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE MOON BUT IT IS THE VASTLY GREATER DISTANCE THAT GIVES IT THE SAME APPARENT SIZE AS THE MUCH CLOSER AND MUCH SMALLER MOON FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EARTH. THE VARIATIONS IN APPARENT SIZE, DUE TO THE NONCIRCULAR ORBITS, ARE NEARLY THE SAME AS WELL, THOUGH OCCURRING IN DIFFERENT CYCLES. THIS MAKES POSSIBLE BOTH TOTAL WITH THE MOON APPEARING LARGER THAN THE SUN AND ANNULAR WITH THE MOON APPEARING SMALLER THAN THE SUN SOLAR ECLIPSES. IN A TOTAL ECLIPSE, THE MOON COMPLETELY COVERS THE DISC OF THE SUN AND THE SOLAR CORONA BECOMES VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE. BECAUSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MOON AND EARTH IS VERY SLOWLY INCREASING OVER TIME, THE ANGULAR DIAMETER OF THE MOON IS DECREASING. ALSO, AS IT EVOLVES TOWARD BECOMING A RED GIANT, THE SIZE OF THE SUN, AND ITS APPARENT DIAMETER IN THE SKY, ARE SLOWLY INCREASING.L THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO CHANGES MEANS THAT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO, THE MOON WOULD ALWAYS COMPLETELY COVER THE SUN ON SOLAR ECLIPSES, AND NO ANNULAR ECLIPSES WERE POSSIBLE. LIKEWISE, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS IN THE FUTURE, THE MOON WILL NO LONGER COVER THE SUN COMPLETELY, AND TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSES WILL NOT OCCUR.BECAUSE THE MOONS ORBIT AROUND EARTH IS INCLINED BY ABOUT .   TO THE ORBIT OF EARTH AROUND THE SUN, ECLIPSES DO NOT OCCUR AT EVERY FULL AND NEW MOON. FOR AN ECLIPSE TO OCCUR, THE MOON MUST BE NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF THE TWO ORBITAL PLANES. THE PERIODICITY AND RECURRENCE OF ECLIPSES OF THE SUN BY THE MOON, AND OF THE MOON BY EARTH, IS DESCRIBED BY THE SAROS, WHICH HAS A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY  YEARS.BECAUSE THE MOON IS CONTINUOUSLY BLOCKING OUR VIEW OF A HALFDEGREEWIDE CIRCULAR AREA OF THE SKY,M THE RELATED PHENOMENON OF OCCULTATION OCCURS WHEN A BRIGHT STAR OR PLANET PASSES BEHIND THE MOON AND IS OCCULTED HIDDEN FROM VIEW. IN THIS WAY, A SOLAR ECLIPSE IS AN OCCULTATION OF THE SUN. BECAUSE THE MOON IS COMPARATIVELY CLOSE TO EARTH, OCCULTATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL STARS ARE NOT VISIBLE EVERYWHERE ON THE PLANET, NOR AT THE SAME TIME. BECAUSE OF THE PRECESSION OF THE LUNAR ORBIT, EACH YEAR DIFFERENT STARS ARE OCCULTED.OBSERVATION AND EXPLORATIONBEFORE SPACEFLIGHTMAIN ARTICLES EXPLORATION OF THE MOON BEFORE SPACEFLIGHT, SELENOGRAPHY, AND LUNAR THEORYON AN OPEN FOLIO PAGE IS A CAREFULLY DRAWN DISK OF THE FULL MOON.

THE CHINESE ASTRONOMER SHI SHEN FL. TH CENTURY BC GAVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREDICTING SOLAR AND LUNAR ECLIPSES. LATER, THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE MOON AND THE CAUSE OF MOONLIGHT BECAME UNDERSTOOD. THE ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHER ANAXAGORAS D.  BC REASONED THAT THE SUN AND MOON WERE BOTH GIANT SPHERICAL ROCKS, AND THAT THE LATTER REFLECTED THE LIGHT OF THE FORMER. ALTHOUGH THE CHINESE OF THE HAN DYNASTY BELIEVED THE MOON TO BE ENERGY EQUATED TO QI, THEIR RADIATING INFLUENCE THEORY ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT THE LIGHT OF THE MOON WAS MERELY A REFLECTION OF THE SUN, AND JING FANG  BC NOTED THE SPHERICITY OF THE MOON. IN THE ND CENTURY AD, LUCIAN WROTE THE NOVEL A TRUE STORY, IN WHICH THE HEROES TRAVEL TO THE MOON AND MEET ITS INHABITANTS. IN  AD, THE INDIAN ASTRONOMER ARYABHATA MENTIONED IN HIS ARYABHATIYA THAT REFLECTED SUNLIGHT IS THE CAUSE OF THE SHINING OF THE MOON. THE ASTRONOMER AND PHYSICIST ALHAZEN  FOUND THAT SUNLIGHT WAS NOT REFLECTED FROM THE MOON LIKE A MIRROR, BUT THAT LIGHT WAS EMITTED FROM EVERY PART OF THE MOONS SUNLIT SURFACE IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

HOWEVER, IN THE ND CENTURY BC, SELEUCUS OF SELEUCIA CORRECTLY THEORIZED THAT TIDES WERE DUE TO THE ATTRACTION OF THE MOON, AND THAT THEIR HEIGHT DEPENDS ON THE MOONS POSITION RELATIVE TO THE SUN. IN THE SAME CENTURY, ARISTARCHUS COMPUTED THE SIZE AND DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM EARTH, OBTAINING A VALUE OF ABOUT TWENTY TIMES THE RADIUS OF EARTH FOR THE DISTANCE. THESE FIGURES WERE GREATLY IMPROVED BY PTOLEMY  AD HIS VALUES OF A MEAN DISTANCE OF  TIMES EARTHS RADIUS AND A DIAMETER OF . EARTH DIAMETERS WERE CLOSE TO THE CORRECT VALUES OF ABOUT  AND . RESPECTIVELY. ARCHIMEDES  BC DESIGNED A PLANETARIUM THAT COULD CALCULATE THE MOTIONS OF THE MOON AND OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.DURING THE MIDDLE AGES, BEFORE THE INVENTION OF THE TELESCOPE, THE MOON WAS INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED AS A SPHERE, THOUGH MANY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH.IN , GALILEO GALILEI DREW ONE OF THE FIRST TELESCOPIC DRAWINGS OF THE MOON IN HIS BOOK SIDEREUS NUNCIUS AND NOTED THAT IT WAS NOT SMOOTH BUT HAD MOUNTAINS AND CRATERS. THOMAS HARRIOT HAD MADE, BUT NOT PUBLISHED SUCH DRAWINGS A FEW MONTHS EARLIER. TELESCOPIC MAPPING OF THE MOON FOLLOWED LATER IN THE TH CENTURY, THE EFFORTS OF GIOVANNI BATTISTA RICCIOLI AND FRANCESCO MARIA GRIMALDI LED TO THE SYSTEM OF NAMING OF LUNAR FEATURES IN USE TODAY. THE MORE EXACT  MAPPA SELENOGRAPHICA OF WILHELM BEER AND JOHANN HEINRICH MDLER, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED  BOOK DER MOND, THE FIRST TRIGONOMETRICALLY ACCURATE STUDY OF LUNAR FEATURES, INCLUDED THE HEIGHTS OF MORE THAN A THOUSAND MOUNTAINS, AND INTRODUCED THE STUDY OF THE MOON AT ACCURACIES POSSIBLE IN EARTHLY GEOGRAPHY. LUNAR CRATERS, FIRST NOTED BY GALILEO, WERE THOUGHT TO BE VOLCANIC UNTIL THE S PROPOSAL OF RICHARD PROCTOR THAT THEY WERE FORMED BY COLLISIONS. THIS VIEW GAINED SUPPORT IN  FROM THE EXPERIMENTATION OF GEOLOGIST GROVE KARL GILBERT, AND FROM COMPARATIVE STUDIES FROM  TO THE S, LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LUNAR STRATIGRAPHY, WHICH BY THE S WAS BECOMING A NEW AND GROWING BRANCH OF ASTROGEOLOGY.BY SPACECRAFTSEE ALSO ROBOTIC EXPLORATION OF THE MOON, LIST OF PROPOSED MISSIONS TO THE MOON, COLONIZATION OF THE MOON, AND LIST OF ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS ON THE MOONTH CENTURYSOVIET MISSIONSMAIN ARTICLES LUNA PROGRAM AND LUNOKHOD PROGRAMMESOVIET MOON ROVER LUNOKHOD THE COLD WARINSPIRED SPACE RACE BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND THE U.S. LED TO AN ACCELERATION OF INTEREST IN EXPLORATION OF THE MOON.

AS OF AUGUST ,  TEAMS WERE REPORTEDLY PARTICIPATING IN THE COMPETITION. IN JANUARY  THE FOUNDATION ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRIZE WOULD GO UNCLAIMED AS NONE OF THE FINALIST TEAMS WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A LAUNCH ATTEMPT BY THE DEADLINE.IN AUGUST , THE US GOVERNMENT GRANTED PERMISSION TO USBASED STARTUP MOON EXPRESS TO LAND ON THE MOON. THIS MARKED THE FIRST TIME THAT A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WAS GIVEN THE RIGHT TO DO SO. THE DECISION IS REGARDED AS A PRECEDENT HELPING TO DEFINE REGULATORY STANDARDS FOR DEEPSPACE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IN THE FUTURE, AS THUS FAR COMPANIES OPERATION HAD BEEN RESTRICTED TO BEING ON OR AROUND EARTH.ON  NOVEMBER  NASA ANNOUNCED THAT NINE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES WOULD COMPETE TO WIN A CONTRACT TO SEND SMALL PAYLOADS TO THE MOON IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS COMMERCIAL LUNAR PAYLOAD SERVICES. ACCORDING TO NASA ADMINISTRATOR JIM BRIDENSTINE, WE ARE BUILDING A DOMESTIC AMERICAN CAPABILITY TO GET BACK AND FORTH TO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON..HUMAN IMPACTSEE ALSO LIST OF ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS ON THE MOON AND SPACE ART  ART IN SPACEBESIDE THE TRACES OF HUMAN ACTIVITY ON THE MOON, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INTENDED PERMANENT INSTALLATIONS LIKE THE MOON MUSEUM ART PIECE, APOLLO  GOODWILL MESSAGES, LUNAR PLAQUE, FALLEN ASTRONAUT MEMORIAL AND OTHER ARTIFACTS.ASTRONOMY FROM THE MOONA FALSECOLOR IMAGE OF EARTH IN ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT TAKEN FROM THE SURFACE OF THE MOON ON THE APOLLO  MISSION. THE DAYSIDE REFLECTS A LARGE AMOUNT OF UV LIGHT FROM THE SUN, BUT THE NIGHTSIDE SHOWS FAINT BANDS OF UV EMISSION FROM THE AURORA CAUSED BY CHARGED PARTICLES.FOR MANY YEARS, THE MOON HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN EXCELLENT SITE FOR TELESCOPES. IT IS RELATIVELY NEARBY ASTRONOMICAL SEEING IS NOT A CONCERN CERTAIN CRATERS NEAR THE POLES ARE PERMANENTLY DARK AND COLD, AND THUS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR INFRARED TELESCOPES AND RADIO TELESCOPES ON THE FAR SIDE WOULD BE SHIELDED FROM THE RADIO CHATTER OF EARTH. THE LUNAR SOIL, ALTHOUGH IT POSES A PROBLEM FOR ANY MOVING PARTS OF TELESCOPES, CAN BE MIXED WITH CARBON NANOTUBES AND EPOXIES AND EMPLOYED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MIRRORS UP TO  METERS IN DIAMETER. A LUNAR ZENITH TELESCOPE CAN BE MADE CHEAPLY WITH AN IONIC LIQUID.IN APRIL , THE APOLLO  MISSION RECORDED VARIOUS ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOS AND SPECTRA IN ULTRAVIOLET WITH THE FAR ULTRAVIOLET CAMERASPECTROGRAPH.LEGAL STATUSMAIN ARTICLE SPACE LAWALTHOUGH LUNA LANDERS SCATTERED PENNANTS OF THE SOVIET UNION ON THE MOON, AND U.S. FLAGS WERE SYMBOLICALLY PLANTED AT THEIR LANDING SITES BY THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS, NO NATION CLAIMS OWNERSHIP OF ANY PART OF THE MOONS SURFACE. RUSSIA, CHINA, AND THE U.S. ARE PARTY TO THE  OUTER SPACE TREATY, WHICH DEFINES THE MOON AND ALL OUTER SPACE AS THE PROVINCE OF ALL MANKIND. THIS TREATY ALSO RESTRICTS THE USE OF THE MOON TO PEACEFUL PURPOSES, EXPLICITLY BANNING MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. THE  MOON AGREEMENT WAS CREATED TO RESTRICT THE EXPLOITATION OF THE MOONS RESOURCES BY ANY SINGLE NATION, BUT AS OF NOVEMBER , IT HAS BEEN SIGNED AND RATIFIED BY ONLY  NATIONS, NONE OF WHICH ENGAGES IN SELFLAUNCHED HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION OR HAS PLANS TO DO SO. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS HAVE MADE CLAIMS TO THE MOON IN WHOLE OR IN PART, NONE OF THESE ARE CONSIDERED CREDIBLE.IN CULTURELUNA, THE MOON, FROM A  EDITION OF GUIDO BONATTIS LIBER ASTRONOMIAESEE ALSO MOON IN FICTION AND TOURISM ON THE MOONMYTHOLOGYFURTHER INFORMATION LUNAR DEITY, SELENE, LUNA GODDESS, MAN IN THE MOON, AND CRESCENTSTATUE OF CHANDRAPRABHA MEANING AS CHARMING AS THE MOON, THE EIGHTH TIRTHANKARA IN JAINISM, WITH THE SYMBOL OF A CRESCENT MOON BELOW IT.SUN AND MOON WITH FACES  WOODCUTA ,YEAROLD ROCK CARVING AT KNOWTH, IRELAND, MAY REPRESENT THE MOON, WHICH WOULD BE THE EARLIEST DEPICTION DISCOVERED. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE BRIGHTER HIGHLANDS AND THE DARKER MARIA CREATES THE PATTERNS SEEN BY DIFFERENT CULTURES AS THE MAN IN THE MOON, THE RABBIT AND THE BUFFALO, AMONG OTHERS. IN MANY PREHISTORIC AND ANCIENT CULTURES, THE MOON WAS PERSONIFIED AS A DEITY OR OTHER SUPERNATURAL PHENOMENON, AND ASTROLOGICAL VIEWS OF THE MOON CONTINUE TO BE PROPAGATED TODAY.IN PROTOINDOEUROPEAN RELIGION, THE MOON WAS PERSONIFIED AS THE MALE GOD MEHNOT. THE ANCIENT SUMERIANS BELIEVED THAT THE MOON WAS THE GOD NANNA, WHO WAS THE FATHER OF INANNA, THE GODDESS OF THE PLANET VENUS, AND UTU, THE GOD OF THE SUN. NANNA WAS LATER KNOWN AS SN, AND WAS PARTICULARLY ASSOCIATED WITH MAGIC AND SORCERY. IN GRECOROMAN MYTHOLOGY, THE SUN AND THE MOON ARE REPRESENTED AS MALE AND FEMALE, RESPECTIVELY HELIOSSOL AND SELENELUNA THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT UNIQUE TO THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND TRACES OF AN EARLIER MALE MOON GOD IN THE GREEK TRADITION ARE PRESERVED IN THE FIGURE OF MENELAUS.IN MESOPOTAMIAN ICONOGRAPHY, THE CRESCENT WAS THE PRIMARY SYMBOL OF NANNASN. IN ANCIENT GREEK ART, THE MOON GODDESS SELENE WAS REPRESENTED WEARING A CRESCENT ON HER HEADGEAR IN AN ARRANGEMENT REMINISCENT OF HORNS. THE STAR AND CRESCENT ARRANGEMENT ALSO GOES BACK TO THE BRONZE AGE, REPRESENTING EITHER THE SUN AND MOON, OR THE MOON AND PLANET VENUS, IN COMBINATION. IT CAME TO REPRESENT THE GODDESS ARTEMIS OR HECATE, AND VIA THE PATRONAGE OF HECATE CAME TO BE USED AS A SYMBOL OF BYZANTIUM.AN ICONOGRAPHIC TRADITION OF REPRESENTING SUN AND MOON WITH FACES DEVELOPED IN THE LATE MEDIEVAL PERIOD.THE SPLITTING OF THE MOON ARABIC   IS A MIRACLE ATTRIBUTED TO MUHAMMAD.CALENDARFURTHER INFORMATION LUNAR CALENDAR, LUNISOLAR CALENDAR, METONIC CYCLE, BLUE MOON, AND MOVABLE FEASTTHE MOONS REGULAR PHASES MAKE IT A VERY CONVENIENT TIMEPIECE, AND THE PERIODS OF ITS WAXING AND WANING FORM THE BASIS OF MANY OF THE OLDEST CALENDARS. TALLY STICKS, NOTCHED BONES DATING AS FAR BACK AS , YEARS AGO, ARE BELIEVED BY SOME TO MARK THE PHASES OF THE MOON. THE DAY MONTH IS AN APPROXIMATION OF THE LUNAR CYCLE. THE ENGLISH NOUN MONTH AND ITS COGNATES IN OTHER GERMANIC LANGUAGES STEM FROM PROTOGERMANIC MNTH, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED PROTOGERMANIC MNN, INDICATING THE USAGE OF A LUNAR CALENDAR AMONG THE GERMANIC PEOPLES GERMANIC CALENDAR PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF A SOLAR CALENDAR. THE PIE ROOT OF MOON, MHNT, DERIVES FROM THE PIE VERBAL ROOT MEH, TO MEASURE, INDICATING A FUNCTIONAL CONCEPTION OF THE MOON, I.E. MARKER OF THE MONTH CF. THE ENGLISH WORDS MEASURE AND MENSTRUAL, AND ECHOING THE MOONS IMPORTANCE TO MANY ANCIENT CULTURES IN MEASURING TIME SEE LATIN MENSIS AND ANCIENT GREEK  MEIS OR  MN, MEANING MONTH. MOST HISTORICAL CALENDARS ARE LUNISOLAR. THE THCENTURY ISLAMIC CALENDAR IS AN EXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE OF A PURELY LUNAR CALENDAR. MONTHS ARE TRADITIONALLY DETERMINED BY THE VISUAL SIGHTING OF THE HILAL, OR EARLIEST CRESCENT MOON, OVER THE HORIZON.MOONRISE, , PICTURE BY STANISAW MASOWSKI NATIONAL MUSEUM, KRAKW, GALLERY OF SUKIENNICE MUSEUMLUNACYFURTHER INFORMATION LUNAR EFFECTTHE MOON HAS LONG BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INSANITY AND IRRATIONALITY THE WORDS LUNACY AND LUNATIC POPULAR SHORTENING LOONY ARE DERIVED FROM THE LATIN NAME FOR THE MOON, LUNA. PHILOSOPHERS ARISTOTLE AND PLINY THE ELDER ARGUED THAT THE FULL MOON INDUCED INSANITY IN SUSCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUALS, BELIEVING THAT THE BRAIN, WHICH IS MOSTLY WATER, MUST BE AFFECTED BY THE MOON AND ITS POWER OVER THE TIDES, BUT THE MOONS GRAVITY IS TOO SLIGHT TO AFFECT ANY SINGLE PERSON. EVEN TODAY, PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN A LUNAR EFFECT CLAIM THAT ADMISSIONS TO PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS, TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS, HOMICIDES OR SUICIDES INCREASE DURING A FULL MOON, BUT DOZENS OF STUDIES INVALIDATE THESE CLAIMS.NOTES BETWEEN .
